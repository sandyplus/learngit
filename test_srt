1
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:10,860
梦是来自意识深处的信息

2
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,080
我的星球厄拉科斯 在夕阳低垂时美极了

3
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,080
My planet Arrakis is so beautiful when the sun is low.

4
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,460
伴随着滚滚黄沙

5
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:05,460
Rolling over the sands...

6
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,330
可以看到香料漂浮在空中

7
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,330
you can see spice in the air.

8
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,310
夜幕降临 香料开采机在此着陆

9
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,310
At nightfall, the spice harvesters land.

10
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,980
异星人争分夺秒地工作

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,980
The outsiders race against time to avoid the heat of the day.

12
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,750
在我们面前蹂躏我们的土地

13
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:43,750
They ravage our lands in front of our eyes.

14
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,170
我见证了他们对待我族的残忍无情

15
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:48,170
Their cruelty to my people is all I've known.

16
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,180
这些异星人 哈克南人 在我出生前就已来此

17
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,180
These outsiders, The Harkonnens, came long before I was born.

18
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,390
借由控制香料开采 他们变得富可敌国

19
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,390
By controlling the spice production, they became obscenely rich.

20
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,890
甚至超过皇帝

21
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,890
Richer than the Emperor himself.

22
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,450
我们的战士无法从哈克南手中解放厄拉科斯

23
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,450
Our warriors couldn't free Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

24
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,900
但是有一天 诏旨颁布 他们奉命全面撤离

25
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:53,900
but one day, by imperial decree, they were gone.

26
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,280
皇帝为何做此决定

27
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,280
Why did the Emperor choose this path?

28
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,990
今后又会是谁来压迫我们

29
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,990
And who our next oppressors be?

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,960
FOYZI

31
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:53,120
卡拉丹

32
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:53,120
厄崔迪家族母星

33
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,050
你这么早起来很好

34
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,050
It's good you're up early.

35
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,680
你父亲希望你在皇帝的传令官抵达前穿好正装

36
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,680
Your father wants you in full dress before the Emperor's Herald arrives.

37
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,890
整套正装？军服吗？

38
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:08,890
Full dress? Military?

39
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,640
礼服

40
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:10,640
Ceremonial.

41
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,770
既然旨意已定 又何必大费周章

42
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,770
Why do we have to go through all of this when it's already been decided?

43
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,440
这样才有仪式感

44
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,440
Ceremony.

45
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,150
谢谢

46
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,150
Thank you.

47
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,910
想喝水的话 就命令我给你

48
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,910
If you want it make me give it to you.

49
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,530
使用「音控力」

50
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,530
Use the Voice.

51
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,910
妈 我才刚起床

52
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,910
Mom, I just woke up.

53
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,500
把水给我

54
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,500
Give me the water.

55
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,800
使唤玻璃杯没用 命令我

56
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,800
The glass can't hear you. Command me.

57
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,990
把水给我

58
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,990
Give me the water.

59
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,550
就差一点

60
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,550
Almost.

61
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,340
是吗

62
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,340
Almost?

63
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,180
保罗 贝尼杰瑟里特的本事没那么好学

64
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,180
Bene Gesserit skills take years to learn, Paul.

65
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,220
你看起来很累

66
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,220
You look tired.

67
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,560
又做梦了吗

68
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,560
More dreams?

69
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,150
没有

70
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,150
No.

71
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,780
极端的气温和恶劣的气候

72
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,780
Extreme temperatures and treacherous weather events

73
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,830
让厄拉科斯城外的生存条件变得无比艰难

74
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,830
make life outside the cities of Arrakis truly hostile.

75
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,500
飓沙暴的威力甚至足以切断金属

76
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,500
With sandstorms powerful enough to cut through metal.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,920
唯有被称为弗瑞曼人的原住民 逐代适应并生存了下来

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,920
Only the native tribes known as the Fremen have adapted well enough to survive.

79
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,010
他们居住在厄拉科斯最偏远的地区

80
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:05,010
Preferring to inhabit the remotest regions of Arrakis,

81
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,390
弗瑞曼人与巨型沙虫共居沙漠深处

82
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,390
the Fremen share the deep desert with the giant sandworms

83
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,800
弗瑞曼人将沙虫唤为沙漠之主

84
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,800
known to the Fremen as Shai-Hulud.

85
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,140
由于长期接触香料 使得弗瑞曼人拥有了独特的蓝色眼睛

86
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,140
Long exposure to spice has given the tribe their characteristic blue eyes,

87
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,810
人们称之为湛蓝之眼

88
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,810
the Eyes of Ibad.

89
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,810
注：又称「伊巴德之眼」

90
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,020
除此之外 外界对弗瑞曼人所知甚少

91
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,020
Little else is known of the Fremen,

92
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,150
只知道他们既危险又不可靠

93
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:26,150
except that they are dangerous and unreliable.

94
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,370
弗瑞曼人的袭击 让香料开采变得极度危险

95
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:32,370
Fremen attacks make spice harvesting extremely hazardous.

96
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,950
对弗瑞曼人而言 香料是一种神圣的致幻剂

97
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:35,950
For the Fremen, spice is the sacred hallucinogen

98
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,870
能延年益寿并对健康大有助益

99
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,870
which preserves life and brings enormous health benefits.

100
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,670
对帝国而言 宇航公会的领航员仰赖香料

101
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,670
For the Imperium, the spice is used by the navigators of the Spacing Guild

102
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,840
来找寻穿梭星际的安全航线

103
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,840
to find safe paths between the stars.

104
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,050
若没有香料 星际航行将变得寸步难行

105
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,050
Without spice, interstellar travel is impossible,

106
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,520
这也让香料成为宇宙中最珍贵的物资

107
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:57,520
making it by far the most valuable substance in the universe.

108
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,380
笑一个 葛尼

109
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,380
Smile, Gurney.

110
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,740
我在笑

111
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,740
I am smiling.

112
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,740
为了这些繁文缛节 这次他们花费了多少

113
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,740
How much will it cost them, traveling all this way for this formality?

114
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,830
三位公会领航员 往返共计146万零62宇宙索

115
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:01,830
Three Guild A total of 1.46 million, 62 solaris, round trip.

116
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,890
承蒙柯瑞诺家族沙达姆四世皇恩

117
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,890
By the grace of Shaddam IV of the House Corrino,

118
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,440
金狮王座的传人 已知宇宙之帕迪沙皇帝

119
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,440
ascendant to the Golden Lion Throne of Padishah Emperor of the Known Universe,

120
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,150
我身为星变传令官前来

121
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:29,150
I stand before you as Herald of the Change.

122
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,150
在皇家宫廷成员

123
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:33,150
We are witnessed by members of the Imperial Court,

124
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,780
宇航公会代表 和贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹的见证下

125
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:38,780
representatives of the Spacing Guild and a sister of the Bene Gesserit.

126
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,620
皇帝颁布谕旨

127
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,620
The Emperor has spoken.

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,750
厄崔迪家族应即刻接管厄拉科斯

129
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,750
House Atreides shall immediately take control of Arrakis

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,010
并掌管此地

131
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,010
and serve as its steward.

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,470
尔等是否接旨

133
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,470
Do you accept?

134
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,980
我们是厄崔迪家族

135
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,980
We are the House Atreides.

136
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,820
我们从不回避任何责任 也不背弃任何信念

137
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,820
There is no call we do not answer, there is no faith that we betray.

138
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,820
皇帝要求我们重塑厄拉科斯的和平

139
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,820
The Emperor asks us to bring peace to Arrakis.

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,950
厄崔迪家族定不辱使命

141
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,950
House Atreides accepts.

142
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:28,290
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪

143
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:28,290
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

144
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,930
你的印信

145
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,930
Your seal.

146
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,460
所以 完成了吗

147
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,460
So, it's done?

148
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,260
完成了

149
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:17,260
It's done.

150
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,290
如何

151
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,290
How was it?

152
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,290
平衡翼太松了

153
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,290
Stabilizers are too loose.

154
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,330
我们会调整

155
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,330
We'll dial it in.

156
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,290
谢了 朋友

157
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:49,290
Thank you, my friend.

158
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,120
没事

159
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,120
Got it,

160
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,380
邓肯

161
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,380
Duncan.

162
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,290
小子

163
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,290
My boy!

164
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,210
保罗 我的好小子

165
00:10:55,130 --> 00:10:56,210
Paul, my boy.

166
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,390
听说你明天要去厄拉科斯 跟先遣部队一起

167
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,390
So, you're going to Arrakis tomorrow. With the advance team?

168
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,100
对 我明天要跟先遣部队前往厄拉科斯

169
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:05,100
Yes, I'm going to Arrakis tomorrow with the advance team.

170
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,060
我希望你带我一起去

171
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,060
I'd like you to take me with you.

172
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,690
是吗

173
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,690
You would?

174
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,480
那太可惜了 因为不行

175
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,480
Well, that's too bad. 'Cause no.

176
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,980
邓肯

177
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,980
Duncan.

178
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,320
你是想害我上军事法庭吗

179
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,320
Are you trying to give me court-martial?

180
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,610
你是怎么了

181
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,610
What's going on?

182
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,200
我能告诉你一个秘密吗

183
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,200
Can I trust you with something?

184
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,030
当然 你可以信任我

185
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,030
Always. You know that.

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,790
我最近总是反复做梦

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,790
I've been having dreams.

188
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,250
是关于厄拉科斯和弗瑞曼人

189
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,250
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

190
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,600
是吗

191
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,600
Okay.

192
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,260
然后呢

193
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:47,260
So?

194
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,890
我在梦里看到你

195
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,890
I saw you.

196
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,400
和弗瑞曼人在一起

197
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:54,400
With the Fremen.

198
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,530
所以我会找到他们

199
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,530
So I do find them.

200
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,900
这不就成了 是个好兆头 对吧

201
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,900
There you go. That's a good omen right there, right?

202
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,870
兰维尔

203
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,870
Lanville!

204
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,170
我看到你死了 在战斗中阵亡

205
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:15,170
I saw you lying dead. Fallen in battle.

206
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
感觉若我跟你一起去 你就不会死

207
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
I felt like if I had been there, you'd be alive.

208
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,970
首先 我不会死

209
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,970
First off, I'm not gonna die.

210
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,640
-我没跟你开玩笑  -所以你才想跟我一起去

211
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,640
- You're not taking me seriously. - That's why you want to come with me.

212
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,310
听我说 梦能创造故事

213
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,310
Listen. Dreams make good stories,

214
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,940
可醒来后发生的才最重要

215
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:36,940
but everything important happens when we're awake,

216
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,400
因为那才是你要去创造的现实

217
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,400
'Cause that's when we make things happen.

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,400
你瞧你 练出肌肉了

219
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,400
Look at you, put up some muscle?

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
有吗

221
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
I did?

222
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,360
并没有

223
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,360
No.

224
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,990
我们厄拉科斯见 小子

225
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,990
See you in Arrakis, my boy.

226
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,450
父亲 我想和邓肯艾达荷一起

227
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,450
Father, I'd like to ask to join Duncan Idaho

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,450
明天前往厄拉科斯进行侦察行动

229
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,450
on his scout mission to Arrakis tomorrow.

230
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,330
我学过弗瑞曼语 能帮上忙

231
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,330
I've studied the Fremen language. I'd be an asset.

232
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,450
绝不可能

233
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,450
Out of the question.

234
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,210
你和我们其他人一样 过几周再去

235
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,210
You'll travel in a few weeks to Arrakis, like the rest of us.

236
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,750
我从小就接受训练

237
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,750
I've been training my whole life.

238
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,090
-若不让我去面对真正的危险 那意义何在  -你明知故问 保罗

239
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,090
- What is the point if I'm not allowed to face some actual risk? - You know why, Paul.

240
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,010
你是厄崔迪家族的未来

241
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,010
You're the future of the House Atreides.

242
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,300
爷爷当年把斗牛当成游戏

243
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,300
And grandfather fought bulls for sport.

244
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,470
没错 你看看他的下场

245
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,470
Yes, look where that got him.

246
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,810
我需要你在我身边

247
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,810
I need you by my side.

248
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,560
等我们抵达厄拉科斯时 将面临巨大危险

249
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,560
When we get to Arrakis we'll face enormous danger.

250
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,280
什么危险？弗瑞曼人？沙漠？

251
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,280
What danger? The Fremen? The desert?

252
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,820
政治风险

253
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,820
Political danger.

254
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,580
各大家族唯我们马首是瞻 令皇帝心生忌惮

255
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:12,580
The great houses look to us for leadership and this threatens the Emperor.

256
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,040
皇帝从哈克南手中夺走厄拉科斯 并转交给我们

257
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:16,040
By taking Arrakis from the Harkonnens and making it ours

258
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,170
其实是想挑起战争 借此削弱双方家族

259
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,170
he sets the stage for a war which would weaken both houses.

260
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,960
若我们能借此机会 探索出厄拉科斯真正的财富

261
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,960
But if we hold firm and tap the true power of Arrakis

262
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,090
我们将变得无比强大

263
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:28,090
we could be stronger than ever.

264
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,510
那是什么意思

265
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:29,510
What does that mean?

266
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,680
大肆开采香料 继续剥削弗瑞曼人？

267
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,680
Mining spice, keeping the Fremen in their place?

268
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,970
这与哈克南家族有何区别

269
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,970
We'd be no better than Harkonnens.

270
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,190
并非如此 我们要与弗瑞曼人结盟

271
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:38,190
No. By making an alliance with the Fremen.

272
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,520
我派邓肯去就是为了安排此事

273
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:41,520
That's what I've sent Duncan Idaho to arrange.

274
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,740
在卡拉丹 我们依靠空气和海洋的力量

275
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:46,740
Here, on Caladan, we've ruled by air power and sea power.

276
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,320
在厄拉科斯 我们要学会利用沙漠的力量

277
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,320
On Arrakis, we need to cultivate desert power.

278
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,000
你来我的理事会旁听 了解我的工作

279
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:57,000
I want you sitting in on my council, learn what I do.

280
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,710
爸爸 若我不是呢

281
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,710
What if I'm not, dad?

282
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,540
不是什么

283
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,540
Not what?

284
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,550
厄崔迪家族的未来

285
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:05,550
The future of House Atreides.

286
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,770
我也曾跟父亲说我不想继承这个徽章

287
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:20,770
I told my father I didn't want this either.

288
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,980
我本想成为一名飞行员

289
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,980
I wanted to be a pilot.

290
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,190
你从没告诉过我

291
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,190
You never told me that.

292
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,570
你爷爷曾说

293
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,570
Your grandfather said,

294
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,740
「伟人从不自求上位

295
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,740
"A great man doesn't seek to lead.

296
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,620
而是听从呼唤 并挺身而出」

297
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:40,620
He's called to it, and he answers."

298
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
就算你选择拒绝

299
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
And if your answer is "no"

300
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,340
你仍是我心目中的那个你

301
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,340
you'll still be the only thing I ever needed you to be,

302
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,590
我的儿子

303
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,590
my son.

304
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,860
我找到了自己的路 希望你也一样

305
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,860
I found my own way to it. Maybe you'll find yours.

306
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,780
为了缅怀先人

307
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,780
In their memory...

308
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,990
至少试试看

309
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:16,990
give it a try.

310
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,750
不要背对着门

311
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,750
Don't stand with your back to the door.

312
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,630
到底要提醒你多少次

313
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,630
How many times do we have to tell you?

314
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,720
我能听出你的脚步声 哥尼哈莱克

315
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,720
I could tell it was you by your footsteps, Gurney Halleck.

316
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,100
别人可能会模仿我的脚步声

317
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,100
Someone might imitate my stride.

318
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,010
我能分得清

319
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,010
I know the difference.

320
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,720
你是新的兵器教官吗

321
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,720
Are you the new Weapons Master?

322
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,140
邓肯艾达荷不在 我必须尽我所能

323
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:44,140
With Duncan Idaho gone, I must make do as best I can.

324
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,560
选刀吧

325
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,560
Choose your blade.

326
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,900
我今天已经够烦了 哥尼

327
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,900
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

328
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,530
不如唱首歌来听听

329
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,530
Give us a song instead.

330
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,530
也太失礼了

331
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,530
That's rude.

332
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,970
来啊

333
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:14,970
Come on.

334
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
来啊

335
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,550
Come on.

336
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,760
老头

337
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:17,760
Old man.

338
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,480
缓慢的刀刃能穿透屏蔽场

339
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,480
Ah, the slow blade penetrates the shield.

340
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,820
我今天没心情

341
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:40,820
I guess I'm not in the mood today.

342
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,370
心情不好？

343
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,370
Mood?

344
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,620
这关心情什么事？

345
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,620
What's mood to do with it?

346
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,670
战斗是出于需要 谁管你心情好坏？

347
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,670
You fight when the necessity arises, no matter the mood.

348
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,540
给我好好打

349
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,540
Now fight!

350
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,260
来啊

351
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,260
Come on!

352
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,940
我赢了

353
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,940
I have you.

354
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,400
对

355
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,400
Aye.

356
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,980
但往下看看 少主

357
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,980
But look down, my lord.

358
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,730
你会跟我同归于尽

359
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,730
You'd have joined me in death.

360
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,490
看来你有心情了

361
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,490
I see you found the mood.

362
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,000
情况真有那么糟吗

363
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,000
Will it be that bad?

364
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,710
你还不懂 对吧？

365
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,710
You don't get it, do you?

366
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,920
你不懂迎接我们的将会是什么

367
00:18:33,050 --> 00:18:36,920
You don't really understand the grave nature of what's happening to us.

368
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,260
80年来 哈克南家族统治着厄拉科斯

369
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,260
For 80 years, Arrakis belonged to House Harkonnen.

370
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,770
整整80年 他们独占香料区

371
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:45,770
80 years of owning the spice fields.

372
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,100
你能想象他们多富有吗

373
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:48,100
Can you imagine the wealth?

374
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,270
你的双眼 我需要从你眼中看出你准备好了

375
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,270
Your eyes. I need to see it in your eyes.

376
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,690
你没见识过哈克南家族 但我有

377
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,690
You never met Harkonnens before, I have.

378
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,820
他们毫无人性 残酷嗜血

379
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:54,820
They're not human, they're brutal!

380
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,490
你必须做好准备

381
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:57,490
You have to be ready.

382
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:14,880
桀迪主星

383
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:14,880
哈克南家族母星

384
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,610
男爵大人

385
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:40,610
Lord Baron.

386
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,070
拉班

387
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,070
Rabban.

388
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,450
最后一批船已离开了厄拉科斯

389
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,450
The last of our ships have left Arrakis.

390
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,750
完成撤离

391
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,750
It's done.

392
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,670
非常好

393
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,670
Very good.

394
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
叔叔 我们怎能容许这种事发生

395
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,880
Uncle, how did we let this happen?

396
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,170
皇帝怎么能…

397
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,170
How can the Emperor

398
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,840
夺走我们建立的一切

399
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,840
take everything we've built

400
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
并转交给那个公爵

401
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,840
and give it to that Duke?

402
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,100
凭什么

403
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,100
How?

404
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,890
别以为这是在厚待他

405
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,890
Don't be too sure, it's an act of love.

406
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,850
他这话什么意思

407
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,850
What does he mean?

408
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,570
俗话说 祸福相依

409
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,570
When is a gift not a gift?

410
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,450
厄崔迪家族的声誉正隆

411
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,450
The Atreides Voice is rising

412
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,910
而皇帝为人善妒

413
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,910
and the Emperor is a jealous man.

414
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,670
一个危险又善妒的人

415
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,670
A dangerous, jealous man.

416
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,820
保罗

417
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:46,820
Paul…

418
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,950
保罗 醒醒

419
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,950
Paul, wake up.

420
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,460
怎么了

421
00:21:56,410 --> 00:21:57,460
What's wrong?

422
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,080
穿好衣服 跟我来

423
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,080
Get dressed and come with me.

424
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,020
怎么回事

425
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,020
What is this?

426
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,820
圣母盖乌斯海伦莫希阿姆来了

427
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,820
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

428
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,990
她是我在贝尼杰瑟里特学校的老师

429
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:26,990
She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school.

430
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,950
目前也是皇帝御用的真言师

431
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:29,950
She's now Truthsayer to the Emperor himself.

432
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,080
她想见见你

433
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:32,080
She would like to meet you.

434
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,740
为什么

435
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:33,740
Why?

436
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,910
她想了解你的梦境

437
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,910
She wants to know about your dreams.

438
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,500
她怎么知道我做梦的事

439
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,500
How does she know about my dreams?

440
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,460
岳医生又为何在此

441
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,460
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

442
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,010
他只需要片刻时间

443
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,010
He only needs a moment.

444
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,300
少主 你好

445
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,300
Hello, young master.

446
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,300
你母亲让我检查你的身体状况

447
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,300
Your mother asked me to check your vitals.

448
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
发生什么事了

449
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,640
What's happening?

450
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:05,230
因为姐妹会的事我是略有所闻

451
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,650
她们说她们的存在 是为了要造福更多的人

452
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:10,450
并不是要冒犯你的母亲

453
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:14,950
但说到底 她们做的一切 都是为了她们自己

454
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,660
你什么意思？

455
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,830
当心点

456
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,920
少主一切无恙 夫人

457
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,920
His heart is strong as ever, my lady.

458
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,460
别和人提起这件事

459
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,180
保罗…

460
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,180
Paul…

461
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,190
记住你受过的训练

462
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,430
你是谁

463
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,430
Who are you?

464
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,060
桀骜不驯的眼神 和他父亲一样

465
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,060
Defiance in the eyes, like his father.

466
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,350
退下

467
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,350
Leave us.

468
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,520
你必须完全遵照圣母的吩咐

469
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,520
You must do everything the Mother Helen Mohiam tells you.

470
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,820
你竟敢在我家呵斥我母亲

471
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,820
You dismiss my mother in her own house.

472
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,360
过来 跪下

473
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,360
Come here. Kneel.

474
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,450
你胆敢对我使用音控力

475
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,450
How dare you use the Voice on me?

476
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,630
把右手放入盒中

477
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,630
Put your right hand in the box.

478
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,510
你母亲要求你服从我

479
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,510
Your mother bade you obey me.

480
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,140
抵在你颈上的是戈姆刺

481
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:02,140
I hold at your neck the Gom Jabbar.

482
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,310
一种毒针 一触即亡

483
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:06,310
A poison needle. Instant death.

484
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,730
测试很简单

485
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,730
The test is simple.

486
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,510
把手从盒中抽出

487
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:11,510
Remove your hand from the box

488
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,190
你就会死

489
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,190
and you die.

490
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,910
盒子里有什么

491
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,910
What's in the box?

492
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,280
痛苦

493
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,280
Pain.

494
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,120
叫侍卫也没用

495
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,120
No need to call the guards.

496
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,910
你母亲就守在门外

497
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,910
Your mother stands behind that door.

498
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,750
没人能进得来

499
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:26,750
No one would get past her.

500
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,010
你为何要这么做

501
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,010
Why are you doing this?

502
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,010
掉进陷阱的野兽会断肢逃生

503
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,010
An animal caught in a trap will gnaw off its own leg to escape.

504
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,020
你会怎么做

505
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:43,020
What will you do?

506
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,550
安静

507
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,550
Silence.

508
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,190
我不能恐惧

509
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,190
I must not fear.

510
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,110
我不能恐惧

511
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,110
I must not fear.

512
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,410
恐惧会扼杀心灵

513
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,410
Fear is the mind-killer.

514
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,160
恐惧宛如消弭自我存在的死亡

515
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:45,160
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

516
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,000
我会直面恐惧 任由其穿过我的身体

517
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:51,000
And I'll face my fear and I'll permit it to pass over me and through me.

518
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,730
当恐惧离去

519
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:07,730
And when it has gone past...

520
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,400
我会洞悉它的轨迹

521
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,400
I will turn the inner eye and see its path.

522
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,330
恐惧所到之处 万物无存

523
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:27,330
And where the fear has gone, there will be nothing.

524
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,590
唯我独存

525
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,590
Only I will remain.

526
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
够了

527
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:38,800
Enough.

528
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,490
我们巨细靡遗地筛选测试者

529
00:27:55,690 --> 00:27:59,490
Like sifting sand through a screen, we sift people.

530
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,990
若你像只野兽般无法控制内心的冲动

531
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:04,990
If you had been unable to control your impulses, like an animal,

532
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,160
我们就不能放任你活下去

533
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,160
we could not let you live.

534
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,700
你继承了太多力量

535
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,700
You inherit too much power.

536
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,080
就因为我是公爵之子？

537
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:12,080
What, because I'm a duke's son?

538
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,670
因为你是杰西卡的儿子

539
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,670
Because you are Jessica's son.

540
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,090
你继承的不只是身份 孩子

541
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,090
You have more than one birthright, boy.

542
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,090
杰西卡？

543
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,090
Jessica?

544
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,930
你一直用姐妹会秘技训练他

545
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,930
You've been training him in the Way.

546
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,810
跟我说说你的梦

547
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,810
Tell me about these dreams.

548
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,980
我今晚刚做了一個

549
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,980
I had one tonight.

550
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,150
你看到了什么

551
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,150
What did you see?

552
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,360
一个女孩 在厄拉科斯

553
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:44,360
A girl. On Arrakis.

554
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,370
你以前梦到过她吗

555
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,370
Have you dreamt of her before?

556
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,750
很多次

557
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,750
Many times.

558
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,380
你的梦境常会在现实中发生吗

559
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:58,380
Do you often dream things that happen just as you dreamed them?

560
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,380
不完全如此

561
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,380
Not exactly.

562
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,510
再见 年轻人

563
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,510
Goodbye, young human.

564
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,760
希望你好好活下去

565
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,760
I hope you live.

566
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,280
有必要测试到这个地步吗

567
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:20,280
Did you have to go that far?

568
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,570
你不顾姐妹会的规定 教会他秘技

569
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,570
You chose to train him in the Way, in defiance of our rule.

570
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,700
他既然拥有我们的力量

571
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,700
He wields our power.

572
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,780
就必须接受更严峻的测试

573
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,780
He had to be tested to the limits.

574
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,870
如此天赋浪费在一个男人身上

575
00:29:28,530 --> 00:29:30,870
So much potential, wasted in a male.

576
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,910
告诉过你只能生女儿

577
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,910
You were told to bear only daughters.

578
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,460
可你自负地以为 能培养出一个魁萨茨哈德拉克

579
00:29:33,910 --> 00:29:37,460
But you, in your pride, thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach.

580
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,420
难道不是吗

581
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,420
Was I wrong?

582
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
他没有死在那房间 算你走运

583
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,000
You're lucky he didn't die in that room.

584
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,090
若他真是天选之人 他还有很长的路要走

585
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,090
If he is The One, he has a long way to go.

586
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,090
他的洞见力才要觉醒 现又身陷重重试炼

587
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:47,090
His Sight is barely awakened, and now he goes into the fire.

588
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,850
而我们历时百年的计划不容有失

589
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:50,850
But our plans are measured in centuries.

590
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,430
若他辜负众望 我们也有其他备选人

591
00:29:50,850 --> 00:29:54,430
We have other prospects if he fails his promise.

592
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,110
你就这么不看好他吗

593
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,110
Do you see so little hope?

594
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,900
在厄拉科斯 能为你们做的我们都做了

595
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:02,900
On Arrakis, we have done all we can for you.

596
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
路已经铺好

597
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,900
A path has been laid.

598
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,490
希望他不会错失良机

599
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,490
Let's hope he doesn't squander it.

600
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,700
保罗

601
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,700
Paul.

602
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,500
那是什么意思

603
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,500
What does it mean?

604
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,380
什么叫我可能是天选之人

605
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,380
That I could be The One?

606
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,840
你听到了

607
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:02,840
You heard.

608
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,930
贝尼杰瑟里特姐妹会 一直是几大家族的强大伙伴

609
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:09,930
The Bene Gesserit serve as powerful partners to the Great Houses,

610
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,800
但远不止如此

611
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:12,800
but there's more to it.

612
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,680
你们暗中操控帝国的政治走向

613
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,680
You steer the politics of the Imperium from the shadows.

614
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,520
我知道

615
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:18,520
I know.

616
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,350
你不了解全貌

617
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,350
You don't know everything.

618
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,520
数千年来

619
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:23,520
For thousands of years,

620
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,280
我们一直在精心培育血脉

621
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,280
we've been carefully crossings bloodlines

622
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,110
-就是为了培育出…  -天选之人

623
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,110
- to bring forth... - The One?

624
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,530
一个先知…

625
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,530
A mind...

626
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,080
强大到足以连接时间和空间

627
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:37,080
powerful enough to bridge space and time.

628
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,410
过去和未来

629
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,410
Past and future.

630
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,460
引领我们迈向更美好的未来

631
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:44,460
Who can help us into a better future.

632
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,510
我们认为他即将降临

633
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:47,510
We think he's very close now.

634
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,760
某些人相信他已临世

635
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,760
Some believe he's here.

636
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,720
原来我只是一枚棋子

637
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,720
All part of a plan.

638
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,070
开启屏蔽场

639
00:34:15,950 --> 00:34:17,070
Shield.

640
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,330
「呼吸着时间的气息 往事如飞沙般坠落…」

641
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:03,330
"My lungs taste the air of Time, Blown past falling sand..."

642
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,160
杜菲哈瓦特

643
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,160
Thufir Hawat.

644
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,290
我的少主

645
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,290
Young master!

646
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,630
踏上新的世界 感觉如何

647
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:57,630
How does it feel to walk on a new world?

648
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,470
难以克制的激动

649
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,470
Exciting, to say the least.

650
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,680
公爵大人

651
00:36:00,170 --> 00:36:01,680
My lord.

652
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,970
老朋友 你好吗

653
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,970
How are you, old friend?

654
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,430
我的先遣部队已完成布防

655
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,430
My advance team has secured the city.

656
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,890
目前还在排除几个问题

657
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,890
We're still smoothing out a few rough spots.

658
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,140
夫人

659
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,140
My lady.

660
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,780
李桑阿尔盖布

661
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,780
Lisan al-Gaib!

662
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:53,770
李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布 李桑阿尔盖布

663
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:53,770
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

664
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,810
别被他们的热情给骗了

665
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,810
Don't be fooled by the welcome.

666
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,820
他们只是遵照之前的规矩 强制性动作而已

667
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,820
They follow their old masters' rules. Mandatory attendance.

668
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,070
哈克南人喜欢这一套

669
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,070
That's Harkonnen love out there.

670
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
厄崔迪

671
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:08,780
Atreides!

672
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:19,210
厄崔迪 厄崔迪 厄崔迪

673
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:19,210
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

674
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,220
先带你们远离暴晒

675
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,220
Let's get you out of the sun.

676
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,470
这里的太阳能活活晒死人

677
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,470
The heat can kill in this place.

678
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,650
他们刚才指着我们

679
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,650
They were pointing at us.

680
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
他们在喊什么

681
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
What are they shouting?

682
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,230
李桑阿尔盖布

683
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:49,230
Lisan al-Gaib.

684
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,040
意思是「天外之音」

685
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:51,040
"Voice from the Outer World."

686
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,750
预言中的「救世主」

687
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,750
It's their name for "messiah."

688
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,710
这意味着姐妹会已在此处下过功夫

689
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,710
It means the Bene Gesserit have been at work here.

690
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,080
灌输迷信思想

691
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,080
Planting superstitions.

692
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,050
是为我们铺路 保罗

693
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,050
Preparing the way, Paul.

694
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,880
几百年来 这些人一直在等待他们的救世主

695
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,880
These people have waited for centuries for the Lisan al-Gaib.

696
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,890
他们看到你 就看到征兆

697
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:10,890
They see you, they see the signs.

698
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,390
他们看到的都是被安排好的

699
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,390
They see what they've been told to see.

700
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,570
准备起飞

701
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,570
We're good to go.

702
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,360
屏蔽场城墙

703
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:07,360
Shield Wall.

704
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,870
保护城市远离高温和沙虫的侵袭

705
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:10,870
Protects the city from the weather and the worms.

706
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,710
当地人都称其为「上帝之手」

707
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:00,710
The locals call the big one the Hand of God.

708
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,420
这「上帝之手」正在干扰我们的通讯系统

709
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:06,420
Well, the Hand of God is wreaking havoc on our comms system.

710
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,010
太安静了

711
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,010
It's so quiet.

712
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,220
是

713
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,220
Yeah.

714
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,310
这也让我很不安

715
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,310
That's what worries me, too.

716
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,520
那里是飞船港

717
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:24,520
There's the spaceport

718
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,690
扬尘的地方是香料提炼厂

719
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,690
and that plume of dust there is the spice refinery.

720
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,820
两个最容易受袭的地方

721
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,820
Our two most vulnerable points.

722
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,320
我要你守好它们

723
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,320
I want you guarding them.

724
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,030
若我们无法精炼香料 并运送出去

725
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:34,030
If we can't refine spice and ship it off-world,

726
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,030
那就只能等死

727
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,030
we're dead here.

728
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,870
大人

729
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:35,870
My lord.

730
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,040
现在日正当中 我们需要封闭大门

731
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:39,040
The sun's getting too high. We need to seal the doors.

732
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,880
他们是怎么形容这破地方的

733
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,880
What do they say about this hellhole again?

734
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,380
「想洗澡 就用沙子擦屁股」

735
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,380
"To shower, you scrub your ass with sand," my lord.

736
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,880
他们是这么说的

737
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,880
That's what they say.

738
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,050
确实如此

739
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,050
That's what they say.

740
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,390
夫人 这些是管家候选人

741
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,390
Candidates for a housekeeper, my lady.

742
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,070
你叫什么名字

743
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,070
What is your name?

744
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,030
我叫夏道特梅帕丝 夫人

745
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:18,030
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

746
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,080
其他人下去吧 谢谢

747
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:23,080
The rest of you may go. Thank you.

748
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,540
夏道特

749
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,540
Shadout.

750
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,340
这是契科布萨语的古语

751
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,340
It's an old Chakobsa word.

752
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,340
「汲水器」

753
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,340
"Well-dipper."

754
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:35,470
你是弗瑞曼人

755
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,840
你知道这儿的古语？

756
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,840
You know the ancient tongues?

757
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,390
我还知道很多

758
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,390
I know many things.

759
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,890
比如你衣服里藏有武器

760
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:40,890
I know that you have a weapon concealed in your bodice.

761
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:43,600
还不是时候

762
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,600
如果你想要害我

763
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:43,600
If you mean to harm me,

764
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,980
我必须提醒你 无论你手里藏了什么

765
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,980
I must warn you, whatever you're hiding,

766
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,440
都不会管用的

767
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,440
it won't be enough.

768
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,570
这武器将会是个礼物

769
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,570
My weapon is meant as a gift

770
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,610
若你真是那个人

771
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,610
if you are truly The One.

772
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,960
知道这是什么吗

773
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,960
Do you know this?

774
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,380
这是一把晶牙匕

775
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,380
It's a crysknife.

776
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,470
知道它的寓意吗

777
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:22,470
Do you know its meaning?

778
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,350
准备动手

779
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,020
这取自沙漠之主

780
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:28,020
It's a maker.

781
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,690
沙漠深处的造物主

782
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:35,690
A maker of the deep desert.

783
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,120
当你被一个预言长久浸染

784
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,120
When you have lived with a prophecy for so long

785
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,490
其揭露的那刻反而令人震惊

786
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,490
the moment of revelation is a shock.

787
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,160
李桑阿尔盖布 那对母子

788
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:47,160
Lisan al-Gaib. The mother and the son.

789
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,170
它是你的了

790
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,170
It is yours.

791
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,310
沙漠之主的牙齿

792
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:00,310
Tooth of Shai-Hulud.

793
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,630
你好

794
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,630
Hello.

795
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,960
你不该在这个时候出来

796
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,960
You shouldn't be out here at this time of the day.

797
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,330
他们也在外面

798
00:43:56,210 --> 00:43:57,330
They are out here.

799
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,680
弗瑞曼朝圣者

800
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,680
Fremen pilgrims.

801
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,240
他们无所谓会不会中暑

802
00:44:01,410 --> 00:44:03,240
They don't care about heat stroke.

803
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,620
真没想到这里还能有枣椰树

804
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,620
I didn't know date palms could even be found out here.

805
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,570
这些不是土生土长的

806
00:44:08,310 --> 00:44:11,570
Oh, these aren't indigenous.

807
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,580
没有我它们活不下去

808
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,580
They can't survive without me.

809
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,090
每棵树每天都要喝掉相当于五个人的饮水量

810
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,090
Each one of these drinks every day the equivalent of five man.

811
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,720
二十棵枣椰树

812
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:21,720
Twenty palm trees.

813
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,510
一百条生命

814
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:24,510
A hundred lives.

815
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,900
那是不是该移走它们 省点水

816
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,900
Should we remove them? Save the water?

817
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,140
不 不 不

818
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,140
No, no, no.

819
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,760
这些是圣树

820
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,760
These are sacred.

821
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,610
古老的梦想

822
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,610
Old dream.

823
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,000
在厄拉科斯 沙虫是体型最大也最危险的生物

824
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:50,000
The largest and the most dangerous organism on Arrakis is the sandworm.

825
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,220
身长最长能达到四百米

826
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,220
Capable of reaching 400 meters in length.

827
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,230
为了避免发出引来沙虫的节奏性声响

828
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:58,230
To avoid making rhythmic noises which attract the sandworms,

829
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,400
弗瑞曼人选择用沙地微步横越沙漠

830
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,400
the Fremen cross desert spaces using the sand walk,

831
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,190
这种步伐宛如跳舞 毫无节奏可言

832
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,190
a dance-like motion with irregular rhythm

833
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,500
正如沙漠中的自然声音

834
00:45:05,190 --> 00:45:08,500
which emulates the natural sounds of the desert.

835
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,910
得益于弗瑞曼人 厄拉科斯仍有植物幸存

836
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:13,910
What scant plant life exists on Arrakis is thanks to the Fremen,

837
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,970
他们种植来自地球的深根系植物

838
00:45:13,910 --> 00:45:16,970
who have cultivated deep-rooted terrain plants,

839
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:23,590
例如树形仙人掌 沙漠豚草 沙地马鞭草和多枝橙香木

840
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:23,590
such as saguaro, burrobush, sand verbena and incense bush.

841
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,610
据文献记载 牧羊人树的树根最长

842
00:45:24,210 --> 00:45:27,610
The shepherd's tree has the deepest documented roots,

843
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,860
可以深入地下137米

844
00:45:27,610 --> 00:45:30,860
stretching more than 450 feet deep.

845
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,260
这些植物在这干旱贫脊的地貌中 顽强地生长

846
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:37,260
These plants cling to life in a parched nutrient-poor landscape.

847
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,200
是猎杀镖

848
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,200
It's a hunter-seeker.

849
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,290
放镖人一定就在附近

850
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,290
The operator must be nearby.

851
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,670
这个哈克南探子六周前被封入墙内

852
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,670
The Harkonnen agent was cemented into that hole six weeks ago.

853
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,790
通过墙内的水管施放猎杀镖

854
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,790
Ran the hunter-seeker through a water pipe inside the walls.

855
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,680
殿下 让您失望了 我难辞其咎

856
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:06,680
Sire, I failed you today. There's no excuse.

857
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,350
我向您请辞

858
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:08,350
You have my resignation.

859
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,180
你要让我们损失变得更大吗

860
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:10,180
You would deprive us of your talents at this time?

861
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,140
-我的荣誉不允许…  -他们想要我儿子的命

862
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:13,140
- Sire, my honor demands...   - They tried to take the life of my son!

863
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,040
我不在乎你的狗屁荣誉

864
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,040
I don't give a damn about your honor.

865
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,580
想赎罪就去把间谍抓来

866
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:18,580
You want absolution? Go catch some spies.

867
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,770
遵命

868
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:19,770
Your Grace.

869
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,880
让这东西出去

870
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:28,880
The thing must leave.

871
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,110
您但说无妨

872
00:47:29,530 --> 00:47:31,110
You can speak without fear.

873
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,460
我们的宠物听不懂你的语言

874
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:34,460
Our pet doesn't understand your language.

875
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,660
滚

876
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:35,660
Get out.

877
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,560
它听得懂

878
00:47:40,230 --> 00:47:41,560
It understands.

879
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,630
开启隔音锥区

880
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:43,630
Activate silence.

881
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,180
皇帝有何示下

882
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:54,350
他会出手相助

883
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,890
派他的萨多卡军团前来助阵

884
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,810
这事绝不能走漏风声

885
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,810
It must never be known.

886
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,410
厄拉科斯上空没有卫星

887
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,410
There's no satellites over Arrakis.

888
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,130
厄崔迪家族会无声无息地覆灭

889
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:07,130
The Atreides will die in the dark.

890
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:13,200
关于这一点 我们姐妹会并不关心厄崔迪公爵的死活

891
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:13,200
On that matter, Duke Leto Atreides means nothing to our order.

892
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,450
但他的妻子是我们的人 她的儿子亦然

893
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,450
But his wife is under our protection and by extension, her son.

894
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,370
让他们有尊严地被流放

895
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,370
Allow them the dignity of exile.

896
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,260
哈克南家族永远不会违背姐妹会的圣令

897
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:29,260
House Harkonnen would never dream of violating the sanctity of your order.

898
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,700
我向你保证 我们不会伤害他们

899
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:33,700
I give you my word. We will not harm them.

900
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,820
若放过公爵的儿子…

901
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,820
If the Duke's son lives...

902
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,990
厄崔迪家族不会有活口

903
00:48:55,820 --> 00:48:57,990
No Atreides will live.

904
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,010
大人 你向女巫保证了

905
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:01,010
My lord, you gave your word to the witch.

906
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,040
她会知道的

907
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:02,040
She sees too much.

908
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,960
我只说不会伤害他们

909
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,960
I said I would not harm them.

910
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,170
而我的确不会

911
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,170
And I shall not.

912
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,590
但那里可是厄拉科斯

913
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:07,590
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

914
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,220
沙漠容不下弱者

915
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:11,220
And the desert takes the weak.

916
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,770
我的沙漠

917
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:14,770
My desert.

918
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,190
我的厄拉科斯

919
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,190
My Arrakis.

920
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,650
我的沙丘

921
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:22,650
My Dune.

922
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,670
你首次参加战略会议

923
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,670
Your first strategy meeting.

924
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,240
保罗厄崔迪 像古时的英雄那样 徒手拿下猎杀镖

925
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:33,240
Paul Atreides, who catches hunter-seekers in his bare hands like a hero of old.

926
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,850
谢谢你的冷嘲热讽 老头

927
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,850
Thanks for the humiliation, old man.

928
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,370
我总得盯好你

929
00:49:37,850 --> 00:49:39,370
Gotta keep an eye on you.

930
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,290
起立

931
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,290
Attention!

932
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,550
会议开始

933
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,550
Let's get started.

934
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,250
杜菲 汇报运营情况

935
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:55,250
Thufir. Operations.

936
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,160
我拿到了哈克南人账本的副本

937
00:49:55,250 --> 00:49:58,160
I secured a copy of the Harkonnens' account books.

938
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,820
哈克南每年从此处获利一百亿宇宙索

939
00:50:00,110 --> 00:50:04,820
The Harkonnens were taking 10 billion solaris out of here every year.

940
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,930
「因为他们吸取海洋的财富

941
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:07,930
"They shall suck of the abundance of the seas,

942
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,540
沙中埋藏的宝藏」

943
00:50:07,930 --> 00:50:09,540
and the treasure hid in the sand."

944
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,150
短期内我们都无法如此获利

945
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,150
We won't see profits like that for a while.

946
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,070
因为他们留下来的设备过于落后

947
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,070
Not with the equipment they left us.

948
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,210
有多糟糕

949
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:16,210
How bad is it?

950
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,370
这些是香料中转塔

951
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,370
These are spice silos.

952
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,500
我们得装满每一个塔箱

953
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:28,500
We're meant to fill every crate.

954
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,150
全部吗

955
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:30,150
All of them?

956
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
每25个标准日要装满一批

957
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:33,300
Every 25 standard days.

958
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,360
哈克南的蓄意破坏拖慢了进度

959
00:50:33,910 --> 00:50:36,360
Harkonnen sabotage slows us down.

960
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,050
是谁负责仲裁的

961
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,050
But who's meant to arbitrate?

962
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,710
不是有应变仲裁官来监督交接吗

963
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:40,710
Isn't there a Judge of the Change to oversee the transition?

964
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,010
皇帝指派了哪位

965
00:50:40,710 --> 00:50:42,010
Who did the Emperor appoint?

966
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,120
帝国生态学家 列特凯恩斯博士

967
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,120
Dr. Liet Kynes. Imperial Ecologist.

968
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,440
来这里已有20年 据说性情古怪

969
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,440
Been here 20 years. Eccentric, from what I'm told.

970
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,020
我要亲自查看开采现场

971
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:51,020
I want to see these harvesting fields myself.

972
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,280
我不建议您这么做 大人

973
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:53,280
I wouldn't recommend it, my lord.

974
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,770
请那位应变仲裁官同行

975
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:55,770
Have this Judge of the Change accompany us.

976
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,540
我们早该见面了

977
00:50:55,770 --> 00:50:57,540
A meeting's long overdue.

978
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,580
总得寻求点帝国的庇护吧

979
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:59,580
And we'll get a bit of Imperial protection.

980
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,970
找个人质

981
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:00,970
A hostage.

982
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,240
我喜欢

983
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,240
I love it.

984
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,900
他到了 大人

985
00:51:04,450 --> 00:51:05,900
He's here, my lord.

986
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,950
好好招待 他们是朋友

987
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,950
Take care of them. They are friends.

988
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,140
邓肯

989
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:33,140
Duncan!

990
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,440
小子

991
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,440
Ah! My boy!

992
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,450
你肯定长高了

993
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:41,450
I swear you're getting taller.

994
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,950
你闻起来更臭了

995
00:51:41,450 --> 00:51:42,950
Well, you smell much worse.

996
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,930
我和弗瑞曼人相处了四周

997
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,930
For four weeks, I lived with the Fremen.

998
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,630
隐藏在沙漠中 一个洞穴构成的地下城

999
00:51:48,930 --> 00:51:51,630
Hidden in the desert, in a community called a sietch.

1000
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,790
他们的领袖史帝加和我一同回来见您

1001
00:51:51,910 --> 00:51:54,790
Stilgar, the leader of that sietch, has come with me to meet you, sire.

1002
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,450
那地下城是如何隐藏的

1003
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:57,450
This sietch, how is it hidden?

1004
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,670
它位于地底

1005
00:51:57,450 --> 00:51:58,670
It's underground.

1006
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,590
厄拉科斯有数不尽的洞穴

1007
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:00,590
Arrakis is filled with caverns.

1008
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,890
那地方有多大

1009
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:01,890
How big was the place?

1010
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,060
大约有一万人

1011
00:52:02,460 --> 00:52:04,060
I'd say 10,000 people.

1012
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,430
而地下城有上百个

1013
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:06,430
And there are hundreds of sietches.

1014
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,060
上百万的弗瑞曼人

1015
00:52:07,630 --> 00:52:09,060
Millions of Fremen.

1016
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,020
你说对了

1017
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:11,020
You were right.

1018
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,910
原本哈克南预估整个星球上只有五万弗瑞曼人

1019
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,910
The Harkonnen estimate was 50,000 on the whole planet.

1020
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,190
弗瑞曼人暗中监视我好几天

1021
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:17,190
The Fremen watched me search for them for days.

1022
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,530
我一直没找到他们

1023
00:52:17,190 --> 00:52:18,530
I never saw them.

1024
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,920
最后他们派出一位战士来杀我

1025
00:52:18,530 --> 00:52:20,920
Finally, they sent a warrior out to kill me.

1026
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,910
不得不说

1027
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,910
And I gotta tell you,

1028
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,280
这次我差点小命不保

1029
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,280
I have never come so close to dying.

1030
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,040
帝国上下无人能比

1031
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,040
There's no finer fighter in the Imperium.

1032
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,080
他们跟恶鬼一样难缠

1033
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:30,080
They fight like demons.

1034
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,740
沙漠的力量

1035
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,740
Desert power.

1036
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,340
邓肯

1037
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,340
Duncan.

1038
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,210
做得好

1039
00:52:36,310 --> 00:52:37,210
Well done.

1040
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,160
谢谢大人

1041
00:52:37,210 --> 00:52:38,160
Thank you, my lord.

1042
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,920
殿下

1043
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:38,920
Sire.

1044
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,010
那名领袖身上有刀 他不肯上交

1045
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:42,010
Their leader has a knife he won't surrender, sire.

1046
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,890
是晶牙匕 那是他们的圣物

1047
00:52:42,010 --> 00:52:44,890
It's a crysknife. It's sacred to his people.

1048
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,280
让他进来

1049
00:52:44,890 --> 00:52:46,280
Let him pass.

1050
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,700
站住

1051
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:03,700
Stop there.

1052
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,120
喂 喂

1053
00:53:04,330 --> 00:53:06,120
Hey! Hey!

1054
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,520
史帝加

1055
00:53:11,350 --> 00:53:12,520
Stilgar.

1056
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,630
欢迎你

1057
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:14,630
Welcome.

1058
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,270
先生 凡是尊重我的人 我一定也会以礼相待

1059
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:20,270
Sir, I respect the personal dignity of any man that respects mine.

1060
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,390
慢着

1061
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:29,390
Hold.

1062
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,390
谢谢你 史帝加

1063
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:32,390
Thank you, Stilgar,

1064
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,210
用你宝贵的水分作为见面礼

1065
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:36,210
for the gift of your body's moisture.

1066
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,480
我们接受你的这份诚意

1067
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:38,480
We accept it in the spirit in which it was given.

1068
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,570
很高兴你能来

1069
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:47,570
I'm glad you've come.

1070
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:52,190
我相信我们双方能互利更生

1071
00:53:48,470 --> 00:53:52,190
I believe your people and mine have much to offer one another.

1072
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,800
不不 你们是异星人

1073
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:53,800
No, no, you are Outworlders.

1074
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,640
你们只为香料来此 一味索取 从不懂得回报

1075
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:57,640
You come here for the spice, you take it, giving nothing in return.

1076
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,380
倒是没错

1077
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:00,380
That's true.

1078
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,690
我知道你们一直遭受哈克南人的压迫

1079
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:05,690
I know you've suffered at the hands of the Harkonnen.

1080
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,800
说出你的要求

1081
00:54:06,330 --> 00:54:07,800
Name what you want.

1082
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,900
只要我有权批准 我都会无条件答应你

1083
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,900
If it's in my power to grant, I'll give it and ask for nothing.

1084
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,790
我要求你们不要去找我们的地下城

1085
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:13,790
I ask for this. Do not seek our sietches.

1086
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,820
不要入侵我们的领地

1087
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:16,820
Do not trespass in our lands.

1088
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,120
在你们来之前 这片沙漠本就是我们的

1089
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:20,120
The desert was ours long before you came.

1090
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,980
你们可以来挖香料

1091
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,980
So, come and dig your spice,

1092
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,040
但一旦挖到

1093
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,040
but when you have it,

1094
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,650
请回到屏蔽墙的这一端 把沙漠留给弗瑞曼人

1095
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:27,650
go back to this side of the Shield Wall and leave the desert to the Fremen.

1096
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,160
请称公爵为「大人」 或「殿下」

1097
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,160
You will address the Duke as "my lord" or "sire."

1098
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,440
哥尼 先等等

1099
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,440
Gurney, just... Just a moment.

1100
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:38,920
皇帝把厄拉科斯划为我的封地 让我统治并保护它

1101
00:54:32,990 --> 00:54:38,920
The Emperor has given me Arrakis as my fief to rule and protect.

1102
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,490
若职责所需 我无法保证自己不会踏入沙漠

1103
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:43,490
I cannot promise not to travel into the desert if duty compels me.

1104
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,960
但地下城永远属于你们

1105
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:46,960
But your sietches will be yours forever.

1106
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,220
只要我在位 你们永远不会被追捕

1107
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,220
And you will never be hunted while I govern here.

1108
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,320
你的承诺很高尚

1109
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,320
That's very honorable.

1110
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,410
我得走了 我要说的就这些

1111
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:59,410
I must go. That's all I have to say to you.

1112
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,900
何不暂留片刻

1113
00:54:59,410 --> 00:55:00,900
Won't you stay?

1114
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,730
我们会奉你为上宾

1115
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,730
We would honor you.

1116
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,770
我情愿去别处作客

1117
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:05,770
Honor requires that I be elsewhere.

1118
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,620
我认得你

1119
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,180
我不喜欢他

1120
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,180
I don't like him.

1121
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,520
看来计划初有成效

1122
00:55:19,180 --> 00:55:21,520
Our plan bears fruit.

1123
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
但还需要时间

1124
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
But it will take time?

1125
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,060
是的

1126
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,060
Yes.

1127
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,260
还需要时间

1128
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,260
It will take time.

1129
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,720
这是给你的

1130
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,720
Here, this is for you.

1131
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,900
是定位罗盘

1132
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:36,900
It's a paracompass.

1133
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,260
这里的卫星有磁场 所以…

1134
00:55:37,750 --> 00:55:40,260
The moons here have a magnetic field, so...

1135
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,480
普通的罗盘不会指向北方

1136
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,480
a simple compass needle won't point north.

1137
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,360
需要精妙的发条来解决问题

1138
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:45,360
Takes a clever piece of clockwork to sort it out.

1139
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,710
是弗瑞曼人做的吗

1140
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:46,710
The Fremen make these?

1141
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,630
还有蒸馏服 沙实机和各种巧妙的小玩意儿

1142
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:50,630
And stillsuits, and sand compactors, and all kinds of ingenious things.

1143
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,540
沙实机是什么鬼东西

1144
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,540
What the hell is a sand compactor?

1145
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,790
这就是沙实机

1146
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:55,790
That's a sand compactor.

1147
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,330
老天 你快混成原住民了

1148
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:59,330
My God, man, you've gone native.

1149
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,940
你喜欢他们

1150
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:00,940
You admire them.

1151
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,330
没错

1152
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,330
I do.

1153
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,390
他们很剽悍 但却忠诚

1154
00:56:04,120 --> 00:56:06,390
They're fierce but loyal.

1155
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,520
他们天生属于沙漠 能融入沙漠

1156
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,520
They're attuned to the desert. Part of it.

1157
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,190
沙漠也融于他们

1158
00:56:10,030 --> 00:56:11,190
It's part of them.

1159
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,390
等你见到就知道了

1160
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:13,390
You wait till you see it.

1161
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,600
那里美极了

1162
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:15,600
It's beautiful out there.

1163
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,200
全体注意 日出警告

1164
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:21,200
Sunrise warning, all workers.

1165
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,130
今日温度将达到60摄氏度

1166
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:24,130
Temperature today will reach 140 degrees.

1167
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,320
目前温度32摄氏度 10分钟后将上升至49摄氏度

1168
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,320
We are currently 90 degrees, and in 10 minutes, we will hit 120 degrees.

1169
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,960
最后警告

1170
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,950
Last warning call.

1171
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,950
今天早晨各个工作区域温度正常

1172
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:47,950
...temperature in all sectors this morning,

1173
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,290
预计保持在75摄氏度左右

1174
00:56:47,950 --> 00:56:51,290
holding it 167 degrees farenheit.

1175
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,480
北方和东北方向刮来的风将带来大量沙尘

1176
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,480
Winds from the north northeast ... dust

1177
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,190
这位是应变仲裁官 殿下

1178
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,190
The Judge of the Change, sire.

1179
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,190
列特凯恩斯博士

1180
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:09,190
Dr. Liet Kynes.

1181
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,600
公爵大人

1182
00:57:09,190 --> 00:57:10,600
My lord Duke.

1183
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,280
欢迎来到厄拉科斯

1184
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,280
Welcome to Arrakis.

1185
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,160
你就是那个帝国生态学家

1186
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,160
You're the Imperial Ecologist.

1187
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,300
谢谢你的蒸馏服

1188
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,300
Thank you for the stillsuits.

1189
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,230
这是弗瑞曼人制作的

1190
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,230
They are of Fremen make.

1191
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,580
也是最好的

1192
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,580
The best.

1193
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,120
殿下 请允许我检查您的蒸馏服是否妥…

1194
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:23,120
With your permission, sire, I must check the integrity of your suit...

1195
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,310
没关系

1196
00:57:25,270 --> 00:57:26,310
It's all right.

1197
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,250
没事

1198
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,250
It's all right.

1199
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,090
凯恩斯博士 交给你了

1200
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:34,090
Dr. Kynes, we're in your hands.

1201
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,200
蒸馏服是一套高效能的过滤系统

1202
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:43,200
A stillsuit is a high-efficiency filtration system.

1203
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,760
即便是大清早

1204
00:57:43,940 --> 00:57:45,760
Even this early in the morning,

1205
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,270
没有它 你们两小时都撑不过

1206
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:48,270
you wouldn't survive two hours without one of these.

1207
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,770
它能让身体降温

1208
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:50,770
It cools the body

1209
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,490
吸收汗水并循环利用

1210
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:54,490
and recycles the water lost to sweat.

1211
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,950
只要你们在动 系统就会运作

1212
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,950
Your body's movements provide the power.

1213
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,990
面罩内有一根吸管 供你们饮用循环水

1214
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:02,990
Inside the mask, you'll find a tube to allow you to drink the recycled water.

1215
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,890
若运作良好 蒸馏服能保证你们每天只耗损极少水分

1216
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:07,890
In good working order, your suit won't lose more than a thimbleful of water a day.

1217
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,210
真令人折服

1218
00:58:07,890 --> 00:58:09,210
Most impressive.

1219
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,300
也帮你检查一下 年轻人

1220
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:12,300
Let's have a look at you, lad.

1221
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,650
你曾经…

1222
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,650
You've...

1223
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,550
穿过蒸馏服吗

1224
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:17,550
worn a stillsuit before?

1225
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,100
不 这是我第一次

1226
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:19,100
No, this is my first time.

1227
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,120
你的沙地靴脚踝处 松紧带箍得正好

1228
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:24,120
Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles.

1229
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,270
谁教你的

1230
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,270
Who taught you to do that?

1231
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,350
感觉就该这么穿

1232
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:27,350
It seemed the right way.

1233
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:34,030
他了解你们的习惯 仿佛与生俱来

1234
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,780
你是弗瑞曼人吗

1235
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,780
Are you Fremen?

1236
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,080
无论地下城或村庄 我都能通行无阻

1237
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:42,080
I am accepted in both sietch and village.

1238
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,420
好了 和我去看看香料沙吧

1239
00:58:42,620 --> 00:58:45,420
Now, come and see the spice sands

1240
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,330
你们往后的生计都得靠它

1241
00:58:45,420 --> 00:58:48,330
on which your livelihood depends.

1242
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,940
若扑翼机不得不在此迫降 怎么办

1243
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,940
What would you do if your ornithopter went down out here?

1244
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,330
你不会想在这里着陆的

1245
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:31,330
You wouldn't want to go down out there.

1246
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,040
这里是沙虫的地盘

1247
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,040
It's worm territory.

1248
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,710
是沙尘云

1249
00:59:35,670 --> 00:59:36,710
Dust cloud.

1250
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,090
看到了

1251
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:39,090
I see it.

1252
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,300
那是你们的香料开采车

1253
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,300
That's one of your harvesters.

1254
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,140
你们可以看到上方飘散着香料

1255
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,140
You can see the spice scattered over the surface.

1256
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,380
从颜色判断 香料浓度很高

1257
01:00:12,870 --> 01:00:16,380
A rich spice bed by the color.

1258
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,010
再飞高一点 可以看得更清楚

1259
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:19,010
If you get a little higher, you'll have a better view.

1260
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,270
那几架侦察机正在搜寻虫迹

1261
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,270
You see these spotter aircraft looking for wormsign.

1262
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,690
虫迹？

1263
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:39,690
Wormsign?

1264
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,030
一条涌向开采车的沙浪

1265
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,030
A sand wave moving toward the crawler.

1266
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:46,110
沙虫通常游走在地底深处 但发动袭击时会浮上地表

1267
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:46,110
Worms travel deep but get closer to the surface when they attack.

1268
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,900
若你们愿意等的话

1269
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:48,900
If you are patient,

1270
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,590
应该能看到一条

1271
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,590
we should see one.

1272
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,500
沙虫经常出没吗

1273
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:52,500
A worm always comes?

1274
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,250
是的 它们会被有节奏的声音吸引

1275
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:55,250
Always. They're drawn by rhythmic noises.

1276
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,840
为何不给开采车加上屏蔽场

1277
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:57,840
Why don't we just shield the crawlers?

1278
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,270
在沙漠使用屏蔽场等于自寻死路

1279
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,270
A shield's a death sentence in the desert.

1280
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,270
那更会吸引沙虫 并诱使它们大开杀戒

1281
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,270
It attracts the worms and drives them into a killing frenzy.

1282
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,930
那是沙虫吗

1283
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:07,930
Is that a worm?

1284
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,160
还是条大的

1285
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:21,160
Big one.

1286
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,400
你的视力不错

1287
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:23,400
You have good eyes.

1288
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,920
呼叫DA9号开采车

1289
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,920
Calling crawler Delta Ajax niner.

1290
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,370
警告 发现虫迹 请回答

1291
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:29,370

1292
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,250
谁在呼叫DA9号 完毕

1293
01:01:29,370 --> 01:01:33,250
Who calls Delta Ajax niner? Over.

1294
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,900
他们好像还挺淡定

1295
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:34,900
They seem pretty calm about it.

1296
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,460
机密飞行 执行帝国勤务

1297
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:37,460
Unlisted flight. Imperium business.

1298
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,810
虫迹在你们东北方向 距离3.7公里

1299
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:41,810
Wormsign north and east of you. 3.7 kilometers.

1300
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:45,650
DA9 我是1号侦察机 虫迹确认

1301
01:01:41,810 --> 01:01:45,650
Delta Ajax niner, this is Spotter One. Wormsign confirmed.

1302
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,700
请等候接触点定位

1303
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,700
Stand by for contact fix.

1304
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,880
沙虫正沿侦查路线向你靠近 预计五分钟后接触

1305
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:56,880
Worm is on intercept course to your position. Contact in five minutes.

1306
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,740
所以现在怎么办

1307
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,740
So, what happens now?

1308
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,310
他们会呼叫运载器来载走开采车

1309
01:01:58,740 --> 01:02:01,310
They'll call a carryall to lift the crawler.

1310
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,310
开采车会工作到最后一刻

1311
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:03,310
They'll harvest right up to the last minute.

1312
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,220
呼叫A0运载器 请求进行对接

1313
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,220
Calling carryall Alpha Zero. Ready for docking sequence.

1314
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,530
五分钟后接触 完毕

1315
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:09,530
Contact five minutes. Over.

1316
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,040
有谁看到运载器吗

1317
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:16,040
Anybody got a visual on the carryall?

1318
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,720
在那里

1319
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:21,720
There it is.

1320
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,920
A0运载器呼叫DA9

1321
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:24,920
This is carryall Alpha Zero to Delta Ajax niner.

1322
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,550
我们将从你们东方迫近

1323
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:27,550
Approaching from your east.

1324
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,980
调整高度 启动对接装置

1325
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:30,980
Correcting altitude and preparing docking equipment.

1326
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,310
收到 A0 启动对接程序

1327
01:02:30,980 --> 01:02:34,310
Copy, Alpha Zero. Initiating docking sequence.

1328

对接程序已经启动 做好安全防护

1335
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,940
Docking sequence initiated. Brace yourselves.

1336
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,140
A0 有一个点没对接上

1337
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:49,140
Alpha Zero, we're short one point of contact.

1338
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,490
什么情况

1339
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,490
What is going on?

1340
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,840
有一个固定器失灵了

1341
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:52,840
It's one of the anchors. It's dead.

1342
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,800
该死

1343
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,800
Shit.

1344
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,330
运载器出现状况

1345
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,330
Carryall unable to receive.

1346
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,330
缺少一个固定点 无法载运

1347
01:02:57,330 --> 01:02:59,330
Unable to lift without that anchor.

1348
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,090
所有人员请注意

1349
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:01,090
All call! All call!

1350
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:03,780

液压装置损毁 无法修复 请尽快撤离

1355
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:09,180

Try it again!

1360
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,040
开采车上有多少人

1361
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:12,040
How many men on that crawler?

1362
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,100
一共21人

1363
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:13,100
Crew of 21.

1364
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,830
我们每艘可带六人

1365
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:14,830
Our ships can take six each.

1366
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,190
那还差三人

1367
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,190
That's still three short.

1368
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,780
会有办法的

1369
01:03:16,750 --> 01:03:17,780
We'll find a way.

1370
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,970
我是雷托厄崔迪公爵

1371
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,970
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

1372
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,920
我们将前往协助疏散DA9机组员

1373
01:03:32,420 --> 01:03:35,920
We're coming down to extract the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

1374
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,740
我们会在西边降落

1375
01:03:35,920 --> 01:03:37,740
We'll set down on the west.

1376
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,840
每个屏蔽场发生器的重量是100公斤

1377
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:50,840
Shield generators weigh 100 kilos each.

1378
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,110
好的 哥尼 让护卫都扔掉屏蔽场发生器

1379
01:03:50,840 --> 01:03:54,110
Yes, Gurney, have our escorts throw out the shield generators.

1380
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:54,850
遵命 殿下

1381
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:54,850
Yes, sire.

1382
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,810
保罗 你去机身后方引导他们撤离

1383
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:57,810
And, Paul, I want you at the back of the thopter. Guide them in.

1384
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,100
DA9 七人一组 随我们撤离

1385
01:03:57,810 --> 01:04:02,100
Delta Ajax niner, put seven men each in my ships now.

1386
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,400
两分钟后接触

1387
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,400
Contact in two minutes.

1388
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,520
越来越近了 各位 我们最好立刻弃车逃生

1389
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:07,520
Getting close, guys. We better abandon ship now.

1390
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:10,820
他们人呢

1391
01:05:09,950 --> 01:05:10,820
Where are they?

1392
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,430
殿下 我们必须按规章行事

1393
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,430
Sir, there's protocol for a reason.

1394
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,590
擅自离开和送死没什么差别

1395
01:05:13,430 --> 01:05:15,590
If we take one step out there, we're as good as dead.

1396
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,820
而且我们车上装满了香料

1397
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:17,820
Besides, we've got a full load of spice.

1398
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,950
-不能弃之不理  -去他的香料

1399
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:19,950
- We can't just leave it. - Damn the spice!

1400
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,430
所有人立刻撤离开采车

1401
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,430
I want every man off that crawler now!

1402
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,740
喂 喂

1403
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:38,740
Hey! Hey!

Seven over here, seven over there.

1406
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:45,340
动作快 快

Kwisatz Haderach.

1410
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:20,200
魁萨茨哈德拉克 觉醒吧

1411
01:06:16,290 --> 01:06:20,200
Kwisatz Haderach awakes.

1412

1413
01:06:29,410 --> 01:06:31,090
Hurry! Get on!

1414
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
- 快 快 快  - 快走

1415
01:06:32,700 --> 01:06:34,700
- Move! Move! Move!   - Go! Go!

1416
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,220
它来了

1417
01:06:39,810 --> 01:06:41,220
It's here!

1418
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,730
保罗

1419
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:44,730
Paul!

1420
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,090
保罗

1421
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,090
Paul!

1422
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,490
我听得出你的脚步声 老头

1423
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:55,490
I recognize your footsteps, old man.

1424
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,420
保罗 起来

1425
01:06:55,490 --> 01:06:57,420
Paul! Get up!

1426
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,090
我们走

1427
01:06:57,890 --> 01:06:59,090
Let's go!

1428
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,120
你怎么了 快点 我们快走

1429
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:03,120
What's the matter with you? Come on! Let's go!

Run!

1432
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,400

1433
01:07:30,790 --> 01:07:31,400
Hey!

1434
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,030
感谢造物主和祂赐予的水

Bless the coming and going of Him.

1438
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,300
愿祂的足迹净化世界

1439
01:07:54,800 --> 01:07:57,300
May His passage cleanse the world

1440
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,180
并为祂的子民守卫家园

1441
01:07:57,860 --> 01:08:00,180
and keep the world for His people.

1442
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:24,690
喂

1443
01:08:23,940 --> 01:08:24,690
Hey!

-你不能再如此冒险  -是 父亲

1445
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:27,660
- You cannot take such risks. - Yes, sir.

1446

-你身上肩负重任  -对…对不起

1447

-我绝不再犯  -走吧

1449
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:30,740
- It won't happen again.   - Go.

1450
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,150
凯恩斯博士

1451
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,150
Dr. Kynes.

1452
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:35,960
你也看到了

1453
01:08:34,950 --> 01:08:35,960
You saw it.

1454
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,160
亲眼所见 一目了然

1455
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:39,160
With your own eyes. It's plain to see.

1456
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,400
他们留下的都是破铜烂铁

1457
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,400
Everything they've left us is in shambles.

1458
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,870
我们被他们摆了一道

1459
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:42,870
We've been set up to fail.

1460
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,460
那架运载器只是刚好老化

1461
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:45,460
That carryall was just old.

1462
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,850
沙漠对装备一向不太友好

1463
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:48,850
The desert isn't kind to equipment.

1464
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,980
如果香料产量无法恢复 你知道会有什么后果

1465
01:08:50,050 --> 01:08:53,980
You know what will happen if I don't get spice production back on track.

1466
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,400
我的职责并不是替你们说话

1467
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:59,400
I'm not here to take your part.

1468
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:04,170
铁打的厄拉科斯 流水的统治者

1469
01:09:00,190 --> 01:09:04,170
Arrakis has seen men like you come and go.

1470
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:10,450
好好照顾你的家人

1471
01:09:06,820 --> 01:09:10,450
Take good care of your family.

1472
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,540
沙漠对人类也不会太友好

1473
01:09:13,790 --> 01:09:16,540
The desert's not kind to humans either.

1474
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,360
香料是一种作用于精神的化学物质

1475
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:36,360
Spice is a psychoactive chemical.

1476
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,480
你似乎对其很敏感

1477
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,480
You seem to be sensitive.

1478
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,240
没什么大碍

1479
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,240
You'll be fine.

1480
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:48,330
谢谢你 岳医生

1481
01:09:46,610 --> 01:09:48,330
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

1482
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,450
那不是过敏反应

1483
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:00,450
That wasn't an allergic reaction.

1484
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,890
我看到幻象

1485
01:10:02,510 --> 01:10:03,890
I had a vision.

1486
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,430
我非常清醒

1487
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:08,430
My eyes were wide open.

1488
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:11,890
你看到了什么

1489
01:10:10,590 --> 01:10:11,890
What did you see?

1490
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,080
魁萨茨哈德拉克

1491
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:52,080
Kwisatz Haderach.

1492
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,690
你能看得到

1493
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,690
You can see.

1494
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,050
梦境很混乱

1495
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:39,050
It's confusing.

1496
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:42,060
我以为看到自己死亡 但好像又并非如此

1497
01:11:39,050 --> 01:11:42,060
I thought I saw my death, only it wasn't.

1498
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,840
有一把匕首 它很重要 但我不知缘故

1499
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:46,840
I know a knife is important, somehow.

1500
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,930
有人会给我一把匕首

1501
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,930
Someone will hand me a blade,

1502
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,750
但我不知会是何人 何时 何地

1503
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:54,750
but I don't know who, or when, or where.

1504
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:01,170
可又有一些事 我心里很清楚 我能感受到

1505
01:11:57,100 --> 01:12:01,170
Some things, though, are crystal clear. I can feel it.

1506
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,630
我知道你怀孕了

1507
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,630
I know you're pregnant.

1508
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,280
你怎么会知道的

1509
01:12:13,680 --> 01:12:15,280
You can't know that.

1510
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,000
我也才刚发觉 只有几周而已

1511
01:12:17,070 --> 01:12:20,000
I barely know that. It's only been a few weeks.

1512
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,570
萨多卡监狱星球

1513
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:30,570
帝国军队星球

1514
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,610
男爵为何需要我们

1515
01:13:06,980 --> 01:13:10,030
哈克南的兵力远超过厄崔迪

1516
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:14,400
厄崔迪军团是帝国中最出色的

1517
01:13:11,110 --> 01:13:14,400
Atreides legions are the finest in the Imperium.

1518
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,970
由哥尼哈莱克和邓肯艾达荷训练

1519
01:13:15,020 --> 01:13:17,970
Trained by Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho.

1520
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:20,410
我们是萨多卡军团

1521
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,160
皇帝的利刃

1522
01:13:22,660 --> 01:13:25,040
敢与我们为敌的人都会灭亡

1523
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,140
没错

1524
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:27,140
Just so.

1525
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,210
按约定派出三营兵力

1526
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:31,210
Three battalions as agreed.

1527
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:39,510
吾皇有令 自当奉命行事

1528
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,870
关于保罗 我有事要告诉你

1529
01:14:11,790 --> 01:14:13,870
There's something you need to know about Paul.

1530
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,650
不

1531
01:14:13,870 --> 01:14:14,650
No.

1532
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,520
我不认为我想知道

1533
01:14:15,870 --> 01:14:17,520
Don't think I want to know.

1534
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,990
自从你的圣母来过后 他就变得不一样了

1535
01:14:18,570 --> 01:14:21,990
Ever since you brought him before your Reverend Mother he hasn't been the same.

1536
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,310
变得心神不宁

1537
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,310
He's distracted.

1538
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:30,460
杰西卡 你为我生了一个儿子

1539
01:14:27,150 --> 01:14:30,460
Jessica, you gave me a son.

1540
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,910
打从他出生 我从未质疑过你

1541
01:14:30,460 --> 01:14:33,910
And from the moment he was born I never questioned you.

1542
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:38,560
我毫无保留地信任你 即便你背着我行事

1543
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:38,560
I trusted you completely, even when you walked in shadows.

1544
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,710
现在我对你只有一个要求

1545
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:41,710
Now I'm asking you this one thing.

1546
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,010
若发生任何不测 你会保护我们的儿子吗

1547
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:49,010
If anything happens will you protect our son?

1548
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,220
不惜我的性命

1549
01:14:50,740 --> 01:14:52,220
With my life.

1550
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,760
我问的不是他的母亲 而是贝尼杰瑟里特的一员

1551
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,760
I'm not asking his mother, I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

1552
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,530
你会保护保罗吗

1553
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:00,530
Will you protect Paul?

1554
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,600
你为何会这样想

1555
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,600
Why are you having these thoughts?

1556
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,410
雷托 这不像你

1557
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:17,410
Leto, this is not you.

1558
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,050
我以为我们还有时间

1559
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,050
I thought we'd have more time.

1560
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,860
晚安 保罗少主

1561
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:46,860
Have a good night, Master Paul.

1562
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,860
晚安 岳医生

1563
01:15:47,470 --> 01:15:48,860
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

1564
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,530
你需要好好睡一觉

1565
01:15:58,790 --> 01:16:00,530
You need to sleep.

1566
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,420
不 我不想靠那个

1567
01:16:01,750 --> 01:16:04,420
No. Not like that.

1568
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,640
我应该娶你为妻的

1569
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:21,640
I should have married you.

1570
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,350
哈瓦特 叫侍卫

1571
01:17:40,540 --> 01:17:42,350
Hawat. Security.

1572
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,760
侍卫

1573
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:45,760
Security!

1574
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,720
长官 长官

1575
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,720
Sir. Sir.

1576
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,060
屏蔽场失效了

1577
01:18:51,630 --> 01:18:53,060
The shield's come down.

1578
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,590
见鬼

1579
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:03,590
God in Heaven.

1580
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,160
启动所有武装飞行器 马上

1581
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,160
Get everything with guns off the ground! Go!

1582
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,910
快 快 快

1583
01:19:51,210 --> 01:19:52,910
Go! Go! Go!

1584
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,670
跟我上 冲啊

1585
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:57,670
With me! With me!

1586
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,270
厄崔迪 厄崔迪

1587
01:21:26,060 --> 01:21:28,270
Atreides! Atreides!

1588
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,650
萨多卡 萨多卡

1589
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,650
Sardaukar! Sardaukar!

1590
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,410
对不起 大人

1591
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,410
I'm sorry, my lord.

1592
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,800
我和男爵做了个交易

1593
01:22:27,240 --> 01:22:29,800
But I've made a bargain with the Baron.

1594
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,590
为什么

1595
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:33,590
Why?

1596
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,070
我别无选择

1597
01:22:34,440 --> 01:22:36,070
I had no choice.

1598
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,220
哈克南家族抓走我妻子瓦娜

1599
01:22:36,870 --> 01:22:39,220
The Harkonnens have my wife, Wanna.

1600
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,060
他们残暴地虐待她

1601
01:22:40,700 --> 01:22:43,060
They take her apart like a doll.

1602
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,240
我得将她赎回

1603
01:22:44,170 --> 01:22:46,240
I will buy her freedom.

1604
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,750
而你就是赎金

1605
01:22:46,240 --> 01:22:47,750
And you are the price.

1606
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,240
这会交给保罗 我会尽力帮他

1607
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:54,240
For Paul. I will do what I can.

1608
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,020
而你

1609
01:22:54,950 --> 01:22:56,020
And you

1610
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,560
要替我去杀一个人

1611
01:22:56,820 --> 01:22:58,560
will kill a man for me.

1612
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,690
我会帮你换掉锥形牙

1613
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:06,690
I'm going to replace your peg tooth.

1614
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:10,680
只要用力一咬 这颗牙就会裂开

1615
01:23:06,690 --> 01:23:10,680
If you bite down hard, this tooth will crush.

1616
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:15,680
向外吐气 空气中就将充满毒气

1617
01:23:11,910 --> 01:23:15,680
Breathe out, and you will fill the air with poison.

1618
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,090
那会是你的最后一口气

1619
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:18,090
It will be your last breath.

1620
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,360
但如果时机恰当

1621
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,360
But if you choose your moment well,

1622
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,720
那也会是男爵的最后一口

1623
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:24,720
it will also be the Baron's.

1624
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,400
保罗

1625
01:24:58,560 --> 01:24:59,400
Paul.

1626
01:25:13,540 --> 01:25:15,670
等下把他们扔到沙漠

1627
01:25:16,670 --> 01:25:19,590
让沙虫收拾他们

1628
01:25:21,090 --> 01:25:23,430
为什么不直接杀了他们

1629
01:25:24,430 --> 01:25:27,810
因为我们要面对一个真言师

1630
01:25:28,890 --> 01:25:31,600
我们可以说我们没有杀他们

1631
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:41,400
有疤的那个是聋子

1632
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,260
去死吧 狗杂碎

1633
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:24,260
To hell, dogs!

1634
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,110
我从没和贵族试过

1635
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:02,110
I've never had a highborn.

1636
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,640
你呢

1637
01:28:04,940 --> 01:28:05,640
You?

1638
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:08,540
贝尼杰瑟里特成员也不全是贵族

1639
01:28:06,340 --> 01:28:08,540
Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn.

1640
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,290
对我来说 她已经算是了

1641
01:28:08,540 --> 01:28:11,290
She's highborn enough for me.

1642
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:14,730
先把那孩子丢去喂沙虫

1643
01:28:12,350 --> 01:28:14,730
Let's feed the kid to the worms.

1644
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,650
再给她好好送行

1645
01:28:14,730 --> 01:28:16,650
And give her a long goodbye.

1646
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:18,940
你们休想碰我母亲

1647
01:28:16,650 --> 01:28:18,940
Don't you dare touch my mother.

1648
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,260
闭嘴

1649
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:21,260
Don't talk.

1650
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:29,700
别轻举妄动 你还没准备好

1651
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,540
松开她的嘴

1652
01:28:32,470 --> 01:28:34,540
Remove her gag.

1653
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,420
闭嘴

1654
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:44,420
Shut up.

1655
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:48,090
找到正确的音调

1656
01:28:55,140 --> 01:28:56,640
我们飞得够远了

1657
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,140
把那男孩丢出去

1658
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,800
松开她的嘴

1659
01:29:13,760 --> 01:29:15,800
Remove her gag.

1660
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,880
杀了他

1661
01:29:21,690 --> 01:29:22,880
Kill him.

1662
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,790
给我们松绑

1663
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:32,790
Set us free.

1664
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,160
住手

1665
01:29:46,130 --> 01:29:47,160
Stop!

1666
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,910
割断绳子

1667
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:48,910
Cut the rope.

1668
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,070
把刀给我

1669
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:53,070
Give me the knife.

1670
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:04,920
你的音调 太生硬了

1671
01:30:01,950 --> 01:30:04,920
Your pitch was too forced.

1672
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,150
这是弗瑞曼生存包

1673
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:14,150
It's a fremkit.

1674
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,930
他们损毁了飞船

1675
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:28,930
They've crippled the ship.

1676
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:06,800
你这儿的厨子还不错 表弟

1677
01:32:03,930 --> 01:32:06,800
You have a wonderful kitchen, cousin.

1678
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,350
这是岳医生的笔迹

1679
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:27,350
This is Dr. Yueh's handwriting.

1680
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,730
若有人活着逃出厄拉肯

1681
01:32:28,170 --> 01:32:30,730
If anyone makes it out of Arrakeen alive,

1682
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,010
生存包里有厄崔迪信号器

1683
01:32:30,730 --> 01:32:33,010
there's an Atreides beacon in the fremkit.

1684
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:35,010
但愿他们能找到你

1685
01:32:33,010 --> 01:32:35,010
God willing, they'll be able to find you.

1686
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,080
男爵大人

1687
01:32:43,040 --> 01:32:44,080
My lord Baron.

1688
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,740
岳医生到了

1689
01:32:45,500 --> 01:32:46,740
Dr. Yueh.

1690
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,040
那个叛徒

1691
01:32:46,740 --> 01:32:48,040
The traitor.

1692
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,750
你所求何事

1693
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:50,750
What do you want?

1694
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:53,800
我干扰了他们的通讯

1695
01:32:52,010 --> 01:32:53,800
I jammed their comms

1696
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,880
解除了他们的屏蔽场

1697
01:32:54,420 --> 01:32:55,880
and lowered their shields.

1698
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:00,100
更亲手献上公爵和他的家人

1699
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:00,100
I delivered the Duke and his family.

1700
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,100
和约定的一样

1701
01:33:00,100 --> 01:33:02,100
The bargain to the letter.

1702
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,580
那我该为你做些什么

1703
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:04,580
And what was I to do for you?

1704
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,350
放了我妻子 别再折磨她

1705
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,350
Deliver my wife from her agony.

1706
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,350
对

1707
01:33:09,480 --> 01:33:10,350
Yes.

1708
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,560
我说过会放了她

1709
01:33:43,870 --> 01:33:45,560
I said I'd set her free.

1710
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,030
让你们团聚

1711
01:33:46,500 --> 01:33:48,030
That you could join her.

1712
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,850
下去陪她吧

1713
01:33:52,600 --> 01:33:53,850
So, join her.

1714
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,610
你觉得接下来怎么办

1715
01:34:03,410 --> 01:34:05,610
What do you think is next?

1716
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,480
这是沙槌

1717
01:34:09,260 --> 01:34:10,480
It's a thumper.

1718
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,020
但没有蒸馏服

1719
01:34:11,610 --> 01:34:13,020
No stillsuits.

1720
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,380
那才是我们最需要的

1721
01:34:13,500 --> 01:34:15,380
The one thing we actually need.

1722
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:23,470
几百年来 我们家族间争战不休

1723
01:34:20,290 --> 01:34:23,470
For hundreds of years, we've traded blood for blood.

1724
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,130
该结束了

1725
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,130
But no more.

1726
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:31,370
你儿子死了 你的宠妾也死了

1727
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:31,370
Your son is dead. Your concubine is dead.

1728
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,010
今晚 厄崔迪家族就此陨落

1729
01:34:32,380 --> 01:34:35,010
Tonight the House of Atreides falls.

1730
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,240
你的血脉将从此断绝

1731
01:34:37,990 --> 01:34:40,240
And your bloodline ends forever.

1732
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,870
你说什么

1733
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,870
What did you say?

1734
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,760
我既来此…

1735
01:35:05,370 --> 01:35:06,760
Here I am...

1736
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:09,680
必当永世留存

1737
01:35:07,990 --> 01:35:09,680
here I remain.

1738
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,710
凯恩斯

1739
01:36:53,570 --> 01:36:54,710
Kynes!

1740
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,750
你待在这里不安全

1741
01:36:55,760 --> 01:36:57,750
It's not safe for you here.

1742
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,500
你会告诉兰兹拉德联合会 我们被出卖了吗

1743
01:36:57,750 --> 01:37:00,500
Will you tell the Great Houses of the Landsraad how we were betrayed?

1744
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,580
我们的精英又是如何被谋杀的？

1745
01:37:00,500 --> 01:37:02,580
How the best of them were murdered?

1746
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,810
我接到的命令是保持沉默

1747
01:37:03,220 --> 01:37:05,810
I am commanded to say nothing.

1748
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,510
什么都没看到

1749
01:37:06,830 --> 01:37:08,510
To see nothing.

1750
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,650
皇帝是派我们来这里送死

1751
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:12,650
The Emperor sent us here to die.

1752
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,700
帐篷里有香料

1753
01:38:01,100 --> 01:38:02,700
There's spice in the tent.

1754
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,570
这就是未来 它来了

1755
01:39:29,160 --> 01:39:31,570
That's the future. It's coming.

1756
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,040
圣战在宇宙中蔓延 就像生生不息的野火

1757
01:39:46,460 --> 01:39:50,040
Holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire.

1758
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,350
保罗 你在害怕 我能感受到

1759
01:40:03,170 --> 01:40:05,350
Paul, you're scared. I can see it.

1760
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,080
告诉我你在害怕什么

1761
01:40:05,970 --> 01:40:08,080
Tell me, please, what do you fear?

1762
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:20,570
谁来帮帮我 拜托

1763
01:40:18,050 --> 01:40:20,570
Somebody help me, please.

1764
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:22,210
保罗

1765
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:22,210
Paul.

1766
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,790
它来了

1767
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:25,790
It's coming.

1768
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:30,340
我看到一场圣战在宇宙中蔓延 就像生生不息的野火

1769
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:30,340
I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire.

1770
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:35,020
一名勇士以我父之名 挥舞着厄崔迪家族的战旗

1771
01:40:30,340 --> 01:40:35,020
A warrior religion that waves the Atreides banner in my father's name.

1772
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:35,430
保罗

1773
01:40:34,620 --> 01:40:35,430
Paul.

1774
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:39,530
军团膜拜供奉着父亲头骨的圣坛

1775
01:40:35,020 --> 01:40:39,530
Fanatical legions worshipping at the shrine of my father's skull.

1776
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,720
一场以我之名而起的战争

1777
01:40:40,060 --> 01:40:42,720
A war in my name!

1778
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,980
大家都在呐喊我的名字

1779
01:40:42,720 --> 01:40:44,980
Everyone's shouting my name!

1780
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,600
保罗

1781
01:40:44,980 --> 01:40:45,600
Paul.

1782
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,840
保罗厄崔迪

1783
01:40:49,210 --> 01:40:50,840
Paul Atreides.

1784
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,640
你是你父亲的儿子 你是我的儿子

1785
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:54,640
You are your father's son. You are my son.

1786
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:57,440
你是保罗厄崔迪公爵

1787
01:40:54,640 --> 01:40:57,440
You are the Duke Paul Atreides.

1788
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,240
你知道自己谁 你知道的

1789
01:40:58,280 --> 01:41:01,240
You know who you are. You know who you are.

1790
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,620
别碰我

1791
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:02,620
Get off me!

1792
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,860
都是你害的

1793
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,860
You did this to me!

1794
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,590
是你们姐妹会把我变成了怪物

1795
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:08,590
You Bene Gesserit made me a freak!

1796
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:35,480
我父亲死了

1797
01:41:33,530 --> 01:41:35,480
My father is dead.

1798
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:13,600
有人来了

1799
01:42:12,510 --> 01:42:13,600
Someone's near.

1800
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,170
你需要水

1801
01:42:14,920 --> 01:42:16,170
You need to drink.

1802
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,140
这是帐篷过滤后的水

1803
01:42:18,060 --> 01:42:20,140
It's recycled water from the tent.

1804
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,480
全是汗水和泪水

1805
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:29,480
Sweat and tears.

1806
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,830
好了 我们走吧

1807
01:42:33,490 --> 01:42:34,830
All right, let's get out of here.

1808
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:49,710
是邓肯

1809
01:43:48,710 --> 01:43:49,710
That's Duncan.

1810
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,390
邓肯

1811
01:43:57,420 --> 01:43:58,390
Duncan.

1812
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,670
夫人 保罗

1813
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,670
My lady. Paul.

1814
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,570
我很遗憾 你父亲…

1815
01:44:03,200 --> 01:44:05,570
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1816
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,510
我们知道了

1817
01:44:05,570 --> 01:44:06,510
We know.

1818
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,050
公爵大人

1819
01:44:08,780 --> 01:44:10,050
My lord Duke.

1820
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,520
拿去

1821
01:44:23,790 --> 01:44:24,520
Here.

1822
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:27,780
喝这个

1823
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:27,780
Drink this.

1824
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:39,060
哈克南同时袭击了这里所有人口密集的区域

1825
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:39,060
Harkonnens hit every population center on the planet at once.

1826
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,730
至少有十个军团 数百艘飞船

1827
01:44:39,060 --> 01:44:41,730
There must have been 10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1828
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:45,110
萨多卡军团也参与了 至少有两个营

1829
01:44:41,730 --> 01:44:45,110
There were Sardaukar with them. At least two battalions.

1830
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:46,460
你确定吗

1831
01:44:45,110 --> 01:44:46,460
What? Are you sure?

1832
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:48,570
只要你和他们交过手

1833
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:48,570
You cross swords with a Sardaukar,

1834
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,180
就绝不会认错

1835
01:44:49,440 --> 01:44:50,180
you know it.

1836
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:54,150
所以 皇帝做出了选择

1837
01:44:51,380 --> 01:44:54,150
So, the Emperor's taken a side.

1838
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,890
应变仲裁官 你又怎么说

1839
01:44:55,500 --> 01:44:57,890
What says the Judge of the Change?

1840
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,880
皇帝禁止我对任何事情发言

1841
01:44:58,690 --> 01:45:00,880
The Emperor forbids me from saying anything at all.

1842
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,250
可你还是冒着生命危险来帮助我们

1843
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:03,250
And yet you risk your life to help us.

1844
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,440
飓沙暴要来了

1845
01:45:23,350 --> 01:45:24,440
Storm's coming.

1846
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,310
沙暴几小时后就会到达 这里很安全

1847
01:45:38,960 --> 01:45:42,310
The storm will be here in a few hours. We'll be safe here.

1848
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,610
知道这里是什么地方吗

1849
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:45,610
Do you know what this place is?

1850
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,610
这是一个古老的生态试验站

1851
01:45:46,250 --> 01:45:48,610
It's an old ecological testing station.

1852
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,000
他们本想改造这颗星球

1853
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:54,000
They were meant to tame the planet.

1854
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,290
释放深藏在沙漠底下的地下水

1855
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,290
Free the water locked beneath the sands.

1856
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,710
厄拉科斯本可成为天堂

1857
01:45:59,490 --> 01:46:01,710
Arrakis could have been a paradise.

1858
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,340
然而工程刚开始 他们就发现了香料

1859
01:46:02,140 --> 01:46:05,340
The work had begun, but then the spice was discovered.

1860
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,100
于是没人再提移除沙漠的事

1861
01:46:05,340 --> 01:46:08,100
And suddenly no one wanted the desert to go away.

1862
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,120
坦纳 找几件适合客人穿的蒸馏服

1863
01:46:08,100 --> 01:46:11,120
Tanat, will you find stillsuits to fit our visitors?

1864
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,270
好的 列特

1865
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,270
Yes, Liet.

1866
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:14,020
沙米尔 请准备几杯咖啡

1867
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:14,020
Shamir, a coffee service, please.

1868
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,390
没问题 列特

1869
01:46:14,020 --> 01:46:15,390
Of course, Liet.

1870
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,270
你和弗瑞曼人是什么关系

1871
01:46:17,780 --> 01:46:19,270
Who are you to the Fremen?

1872
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:12,480
你知道各大家族最怕什么吗 凯恩斯博士

1873
01:47:09,630 --> 01:47:12,480
You know what the Great Houses fear most, Dr. Kynes?

1874
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,340
正是我们在这里所发生的事

1875
01:47:14,320 --> 01:47:16,340
Exactly what has happened to us here.

1876
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,490
萨多卡军团前来 将他们一一铲除

1877
01:47:17,550 --> 01:47:20,490
The Sardaukar coming and picking them off one by one.

1878
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:26,430
唯有团结 他们才能与帝国抗衡

1879
01:47:23,530 --> 01:47:26,430
Only together can they stand a chance against the Imperium.

1880
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,200
你会为我们作证吗

1881
01:47:28,700 --> 01:47:30,200
Would you bear witness?

1882
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:33,780
证实皇帝在这里暗算我们

1883
01:47:31,030 --> 01:47:33,780
Testify that the Emperor has moved against us here?

1884
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:36,470
若他们相信我

1885
01:47:34,210 --> 01:47:36,470
If they believe me,

1886
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,100
各大家族和皇帝之间就会爆发全面战争

1887
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:41,100
there would be general warfare between the Great Houses and the Emperor.

1888
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:44,310
战乱 将席卷整个帝国

1889
01:47:41,100 --> 01:47:44,310
Chaos across the Imperium.

1890
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:47,650
要是我能给皇帝第二个选择呢

1891
01:47:44,310 --> 01:47:47,650
Suppose I presented the Emperor with an alternative to chaos.

1892
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,150
皇帝没有儿子

1893
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,150
The Emperor has no sons.

1894
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,360
他的女儿尚未成婚

1895
01:47:50,150 --> 01:47:52,360
And his daughters have yet to marry.

1896
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,240
你是要篡夺皇位吗

1897
01:47:52,360 --> 01:47:55,240
You'd make a play for the throne?

1898
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:59,110
皇帝惧怕厄崔迪家族 才安排你们来此地送死

1899
01:47:55,240 --> 01:47:59,110
The Emperor feared the Atreides. He brought you here to kill you.

1900
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,110
你怎么还不明白

1901
01:47:59,110 --> 01:48:01,110
What don't you understand?

1902
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,790
你不过是个躲在地下不知所措的孩子

1903
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:04,790
You're a lost boy hiding in a hole in the ground.

1904
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,750
弗瑞曼人提过李桑阿尔盖布

1905
01:48:09,200 --> 01:48:11,750
The Fremen speak of the Lisan al-Gaib.

1906
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,340
别乱说话

1907
01:48:12,750 --> 01:48:14,340
Careful.

1908
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:18,090
「天外之音」将带领他们进入天堂

1909
01:48:14,740 --> 01:48:18,090
The Voice from the Outer World who will lead them to paradise.

1910
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,640
迷信而已

1911
01:48:19,440 --> 01:48:20,640
Superstition.

1912
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,560
我知道你与一名弗瑞曼战士相恋 可他战死沙场

1913
01:48:25,560 --> 01:48:28,560
I know you loved a Fremen warrior and lost him in battle.

1914
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,480
我知道你有多重身份 在两股势力之间周旋

1915
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:35,480
I know you walk in two worlds and are known by many names.

1916
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,400
我见过你的梦境

1917
01:48:40,840 --> 01:48:42,400
I've seen your dream.

1918
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,360
博士 如果我是皇帝

1919
01:48:47,020 --> 01:48:48,360
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1920
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,560
我只要挥挥手就能把厄拉科斯变成天堂

1921
01:48:48,360 --> 01:48:51,560
I could make a paradise of Arrakis with a wave of my hand.

1922
01:48:54,210 --> 01:48:57,130
你们真认为他是天选之人？

1923
01:48:58,130 --> 01:49:00,010
他看起来太年轻了

1924
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:48,490
萨多卡

1925
01:50:47,490 --> 01:50:48,490
Sardaukar!

1926
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:53,050
不要 邓肯

1927
01:50:51,660 --> 01:50:53,050
No! Duncan!

1928
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,290
保罗 不要

1929
01:50:53,050 --> 01:50:54,290
Paul, no!

1930
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,580
-邓肯 不  -不

1931
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:55,580
- Duncan, no!   - No!

1932
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,040
-不要  -保罗 回来

1933
01:50:56,820 --> 01:50:58,040
- No! - Paul, no!

1934
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,460
邓肯 不

1935
01:50:59,230 --> 01:51:00,460
Duncan, no!

1936
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:03,090
-他把门锁上了  -邓肯 不要

1937
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:03,090
- He's locked the door. - Duncan! No!

1938
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,360
他死了

1939
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:53,360
He's gone.

1940
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,020
邓肯

1941
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:55,020
Duncan!

1942
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,940
我们得走了 我们别无选择

1943
01:51:55,020 --> 01:51:56,940
We have to go. We have no choice.

1944
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:06,770
保罗 快跑 保罗

1945
01:52:03,730 --> 01:52:06,770
Paul, go! Paul!

1946
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,760
快跑 跟上

1947
01:52:25,800 --> 01:52:27,760
Come on. Come on, come on!

1948
01:52:59,490 --> 01:53:00,580
跟着光走

1949
01:52:59,490 --> 01:53:00,580
Follow the light.

1950
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,940
你们会看到一架随时可起飞的扑翼机

1951
01:53:00,580 --> 01:53:02,940
You'll find a thopter ready to fly.

1952
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,880
外面的飓沙暴是你们最好的掩护

1953
01:53:02,940 --> 01:53:04,880
That storm out there is your best shot.

1954
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,850
五千米高度以上 大部分都只是沙尘

1955
01:53:04,880 --> 01:53:07,850
Above 5,000 meters, it's mostly dust.

1956
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:11,640
飞进风暴 维持在顶端 往南飞 找到弗瑞曼人

1957
01:53:07,850 --> 01:53:11,640
Climb into it. Stay on top. Head south. Find the Fremen.

1958
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,860
你不一起走吗

1959
01:53:11,640 --> 01:53:12,860
Are you not coming with us?

1960
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,180
只有两个座位

1961
01:53:12,860 --> 01:53:14,180
It only seats two.

1962
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:17,930
我去下一站向兰兹拉德报告这次袭击

1963
01:53:14,180 --> 01:53:17,930
I'll go to the next station and report this attack to the Landsraad.

1964
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:18,710
怎么去

1965
01:53:17,930 --> 01:53:18,710
How?

1966
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,010
我是弗瑞曼人

1967
01:53:19,940 --> 01:53:21,010
I'm Fremen.

1968
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:23,350
沙漠是我的家

1969
01:53:21,890 --> 01:53:23,350
The desert's my home.

1970
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,270
祝你们好运

1971
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,270
Good luck.

1972
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,350
你也是

1973
01:53:25,270 --> 01:53:26,350
Good luck.

1974
01:56:04,770 --> 01:56:07,850
凯恩斯 你背叛了皇帝

1975
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:09,750
我只效忠一个主人

1976
01:56:07,430 --> 01:56:09,750
I serve only one master.

1977
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:13,540
他就是沙漠之主

1978
01:56:10,220 --> 01:56:13,540
His name is Shai-Hulud.

1979
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,110
后面有飞行器追来

1980
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,110
There are jet flares behind us.

1981
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,900
保罗 我们高度不够

1982
01:57:34,060 --> 01:57:35,900
Paul. We're not high enough!

1983
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,090
我不能恐惧

1984
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,090
I must not fear.

1985
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,880
恐惧会扼杀心灵

1986
01:58:10,090 --> 01:58:11,880
Fear is the mind-killer.

1987
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:15,680
恐惧宛如消弭自我存在的死亡

1988
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:15,680
Fear is the little death that brings obliteration.

1989
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:24,450
去见朋友

1990
01:58:21,190 --> 01:58:24,450
See the friend.

1991
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:31,200
去见朋友

1992
01:58:27,800 --> 01:58:31,200
See the friend.

1993
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,350
生命之奥秘并非待解的谜题

1994
01:58:33,680 --> 01:58:36,350
The mystery of life isn't a problem to solve...

1995
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:41,840
而是需要去全新体验的现实

1996
01:58:39,460 --> 01:58:41,840
but a reality to experience.

1997
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:48,730
若你停滞不前 将永远无法参透

1998
01:58:45,210 --> 01:58:48,730
A process that cannot be understood by stopping it.

1999
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,290
跟着它的起伏 随波逐流

2000
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:52,290
We must move with the flow of the process.

2001
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,700
必须投身其中

2002
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:54,700
We must join it.

2003
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,230
必须随之流动

2004
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,230
We must flow with it.

2005
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:58,970
随波逐流

2006
01:58:57,590 --> 01:58:58,970
Let go.

2007
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,590
随波逐流

2008
01:58:59,320 --> 01:59:00,590
Let go.

2009
01:59:35,230 --> 01:59:37,770
他的伤势还没有痊愈

2010
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:52,190
我们的人追着他们飞进了科里奥利沙暴

2011
01:59:48,370 --> 01:59:52,190
We chased them into a Coriolis storm.

2012
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:56,190
风速高达八百公里每小时

2013
01:59:53,900 --> 01:59:56,190
Winds at 800 kilometers an hour.

2014
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:04,540
一旦进入风暴 他们就死定了

2015
02:00:01,100 --> 02:00:04,540
Nothing survives such a storm. They're dead.

2016
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:07,470
毋庸置疑

2017
02:00:06,180 --> 02:00:07,470
It's a certainty.

2018
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,230
总算了结了

2019
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,230
So, it's done. Finally.

2020
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:21,490
给桀迪主星传话

2021
02:00:19,410 --> 02:00:21,490
Send word to Giedi Prime

2022
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:24,210
开始销售我们的储备香料

2023
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:24,210
to begin selling our spice reserves.

2024
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,290
但是要慢慢来

2025
02:00:25,040 --> 02:00:26,290
But slowly.

2026
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:29,240
我们可不希望价格暴跌

2027
02:00:27,350 --> 02:00:29,240
We don't want the price to fall.

2028
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:33,810
为了达成今日目标 你不知道我费了多少劲

2029
02:00:30,100 --> 02:00:33,810
You have no idea how much it cost me to bring such a force to bear here.

2030
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:36,450
我现在只有一个要求

2031
02:00:34,340 --> 02:00:36,450
Now I only have one requirement.

2032
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:38,330
回报

2033
02:00:37,150 --> 02:00:38,330
Income.

2034
02:00:39,070 --> 02:00:40,950
去榨干他们 拉班

2035
02:00:39,070 --> 02:00:40,950
So, squeeze, Rabban.

2036
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:43,150
有多少赚多少

2037
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:43,150
Squeeze hard.

2038
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,250
遵命 叔叔

2039
02:00:43,150 --> 02:00:44,250
Yes, Uncle.

2040
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,340
那弗瑞曼人呢

2041
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:47,340
And the Fremen?

2042
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:49,750
全杀了

2043
02:00:48,410 --> 02:00:49,750
Kill them all.

2044
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,950
高度超过五千米了

2045
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:14,950
We're above 5,000 meters.

2046
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:55,400
一旦降落 就往岩石上跑

2047
02:02:53,010 --> 02:02:55,400
As soon as we land, run for the rocks.

2048
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,240
用这个来呼吸

2049
02:04:47,790 --> 02:04:49,240
And breathe through this.

2050
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:21,790
现在得找到弗瑞曼人

2051
02:05:20,100 --> 02:05:21,790
Now we have to find the Fremen.

2052
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:24,630
你还好吗

2053
02:05:23,650 --> 02:05:24,630
Are you good?

2054
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,870
没事

2055
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:25,870
Yeah.

2056
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:34,380
保罗

2057
02:06:33,490 --> 02:06:34,380
Paul...

2058
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:44,740
不要害怕

2059
02:06:41,610 --> 02:06:44,740
Don't be frightened.

2060
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,950
就连小小的沙漠鼠都能活下来

2061
02:06:45,750 --> 02:06:48,950
Even a little desert mouse can survive.

2062
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:55,050
不要害怕

2063
02:06:49,810 --> 02:06:55,050
Don't be frightened.

2064
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:55,050
你必须面对你的恐惧

2065
02:06:53,060 --> 02:06:55,050
You'll need to face your fears.

2066
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:56,540
一位朋友…

2067
02:06:55,050 --> 02:06:56,540
A friend...

2068
02:06:56,540 --> 02:06:59,910
一位朋友会帮助你

2069
02:06:56,540 --> 02:06:59,910
A friend will help you.

2070
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,930
跟着那位朋友

2071
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:03,930
Follow the friend.

2072
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:07,690
你要学的还有很多

2073
02:07:06,150 --> 02:07:07,690
You have much to learn.

2074
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:11,840
我会教你沙漠的生存法则

2075
02:07:09,470 --> 02:07:11,840
And I will show you the ways of the desert.

2076
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:16,500
跟我来

2077
02:07:15,280 --> 02:07:16,500
Come with me.

2078
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:50,040
邓肯住过的地下城就在那个方向

2079
02:07:44,700 --> 02:07:50,040
The sietch where Duncan lived is somewhere off that way.

2080
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:54,990
我看到了绿色植被

2081
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:54,990
I can see greenery over there.

2082
02:07:55,890 --> 02:07:56,950
在那里

2083
02:07:55,890 --> 02:07:56,950
There.

2084
02:07:56,950 --> 02:07:58,800
说明弗瑞曼人住在那里

2085
02:07:56,950 --> 02:07:58,800
That means Fremen live there.

2086
02:08:03,590 --> 02:08:05,290
等天黑我们再穿过去

2087
02:08:03,590 --> 02:08:05,290
We'll cross after dark.

2088
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,300
弗瑞曼人都是这样行动的

2089
02:08:05,840 --> 02:08:07,300
That's how the Fremen do it.

2090
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:12,870
我们将进入沙虫的领地

2091
02:08:10,790 --> 02:08:12,870
We're about to enter worm territory.

2092
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,840
不能像正常人般行走 否则必死无疑

2093
02:08:13,520 --> 02:08:16,840
We can't walk like regular humans. If we do, we're dead.

2094
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,730
我们必须像弗瑞曼人那样行走

2095
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:18,730
We'll have to walk like the Fremen do.

2096
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:20,250
这叫沙地微步

2097
02:08:18,730 --> 02:08:20,250
It's called a sandwalk.

2098
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:22,540
至少家里的百科全书是这样说的

2099
02:08:20,250 --> 02:08:22,540
At least according to the filmbooks back home.

2100
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,760
好 明白了

2101
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:24,760
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

2102
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,290
来 跟着我

2103
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:26,290
Okay. Follow me.

2104
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:27,610
像我这样走

2105
02:08:26,290 --> 02:08:27,610
Do the same moves.

2106
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:42,900
方向应该没错

2107
02:08:41,510 --> 02:08:42,900
I think this is the right direction.

2108
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:06,650
它就在附近

2109
02:10:05,700 --> 02:10:06,650
It's close by.

2110
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:08,830
我们快离开这里

2111
02:10:07,560 --> 02:10:08,830
Let's get out of here.

2112
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,060
等等

2113
02:10:11,260 --> 02:10:12,060
Wait.

2114
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:15,200
这是鼓音沙

2115
02:10:14,180 --> 02:10:15,200
It's drum sand.

2116
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:21,260
快跑

2117
02:10:20,410 --> 02:10:21,260
Run.

2118
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:29,390
快 快

2119
02:10:27,650 --> 02:10:29,390
Go! Go!

2120
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,410
是沙槌

2121
02:11:41,360 --> 02:11:42,410
It's a thumper.

2122
02:11:47,770 --> 02:11:49,620
有人启动了沙槌

2123
02:11:47,770 --> 02:11:49,620
Someone set off a thumper.

2124
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:06,420
保罗 快跑

2125
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:06,420
Paul! Run!

2126
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:23,870
它们究竟有多大 刚才太恐怖了

2127
02:12:21,230 --> 02:12:23,870
How big are they? That was insane.

2128
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,750
有人引开了它

2129
02:12:28,420 --> 02:12:29,750
Someone called it.

2130
02:12:40,180 --> 02:12:42,430
这里还有别人

2131
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:03,650
不要试图逃跑

2132
02:13:02,390 --> 02:13:03,650
Do not run.

2133
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:08,020
你们只会白白消耗体内的水分

2134
02:13:04,960 --> 02:13:08,020
You will only waste your body's water.

2135
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:09,410
别动

2136
02:13:08,860 --> 02:13:09,410
Hold.

2137
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:19,220
史帝加 喂

2138
02:13:17,100 --> 02:13:19,220
Stilgar. Hey!

2139
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:22,890
你认识我 你来找我父亲时我也在场

2140
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:22,890
You know me. I was there when you came to my father's Council.

2141
02:13:23,850 --> 02:13:25,810
这位是公爵的儿子

2142
02:13:23,850 --> 02:13:25,810
This is the Duke's son.

2143
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:29,220
你还在等什么 我们需要他们的水分

2144
02:13:25,810 --> 02:13:29,220
Why are you waiting? We need their water.

2145
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:32,020
这就是我提过的男孩

2146
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:32,020
This is the boy I told you about.

2147
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,520
我们不能动他

2148
02:13:32,020 --> 02:13:33,520
We can't touch him.

2149
02:13:34,480 --> 02:13:36,440
他怎么可能是李桑阿尔盖布

2150
02:13:36,650 --> 02:13:38,530
他还没有证明自己

2151
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,070
他们都是弱者

2152
02:13:37,860 --> 02:13:39,070
They are weaklings.

2153
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:40,100
詹米

2154
02:13:39,070 --> 02:13:40,100
Jamis.

2155
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:44,960
他们从沙漠之主的眼皮底下来到这里

2156
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:44,960
That was a brave crossing they made in the path of Shai-Hulud.

2157
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:48,800
他的言行都不像一个弱者

2158
02:13:46,060 --> 02:13:48,800
He does not speak or act like a weakling.

2159
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,930
他父亲也不像

2160
02:13:50,120 --> 02:13:51,930
Nor did his father.

2161
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:54,040
是我的沙槌救了他一命

2162
02:13:51,930 --> 02:13:54,040
My thumper saved his life.

2163
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:56,720
理智一点 史帝加

2164
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:56,720
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

2165
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:58,540
他不是天选之人

2166
02:13:57,180 --> 02:13:58,540
He's not The One.

2167
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:03,500
我们有权尊势重的朋友

2168
02:14:01,460 --> 02:14:03,500
We have powerful friends.

2169
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:06,700
若你助我们前往卡拉丹

2170
02:14:03,500 --> 02:14:06,700
You help us off-world, to Caladan,

2171
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:08,140
到时一定重重有赏

2172
02:14:06,700 --> 02:14:08,140
you will be well rewarded.

2173
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:12,360
有什么比你们身体里的水分更值钱

2174
02:14:08,140 --> 02:14:12,360
What wealth can you offer beyond the water in your flesh?

2175
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:20,970
那小子还小 可以慢慢培养

2176
02:14:17,300 --> 02:14:20,970
The boy is young. He can learn our ways.

2177
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,090
他可以留下来

2178
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:23,090
He may have sanctuary.

2179
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:26,980
但这女人软弱无能

2180
02:14:24,180 --> 02:14:26,980
But the woman is untrained...

2181
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,580
年纪太大 没法训练

2182
02:14:28,920 --> 02:14:30,580
and too old to learn.

2183
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,390
退下 你们这群废物

2184
02:15:02,940 --> 02:15:04,390
Back, you dogs.

2185
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:07,230
她会割了我的喉咙

2186
02:15:05,540 --> 02:15:07,230
She'll cut my throat.

2187
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:16,960
为什么不说清楚你是姐妹会的人 还擅长搏斗？

2188
02:15:12,850 --> 02:15:16,960
Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman? And a fighter?

2189
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,410
你们给我机会说了吗

2190
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,410
Conversation ran short.

2191
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:21,620
冷静 女人

2192
02:15:19,410 --> 02:15:21,620
Peace, woman.

2193
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:22,900
冷静

2194
02:15:21,620 --> 02:15:22,900
Peace.

2195
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,300
刚才是我思虑不周

2196
02:15:23,760 --> 02:15:25,300
I judged hastily.

2197
02:15:34,390 --> 02:15:36,100
太阳就快升起

2198
02:15:36,980 --> 02:15:38,860
我们必须回泰布地下城

2199
02:15:40,730 --> 02:15:42,940
等回去后再决定这两人的命运

2200
02:15:48,700 --> 02:15:50,370
在那之前…

2201
02:15:50,700 --> 02:15:52,950
他们有我的庇护

2202
02:15:54,750 --> 02:15:56,750
由我为他们作保

2203
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:06,970
我不会放任你伤害我朋友

2204
02:16:04,870 --> 02:16:06,970
I would not have let you hurt my friends.

2205
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,910
他们说你是救世主

2206
02:16:32,380 --> 02:16:33,910
They say you're the Mahdi.

2207
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,750
我看你只是个小孩罢了

2208
02:16:34,740 --> 02:16:36,750
But you look like a little boy.

2209
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:39,810
你选了条最难的路爬上来

2210
02:16:38,020 --> 02:16:39,810
You chose the hardest way up.

2211
02:16:39,810 --> 02:16:40,740
跟着我

2212
02:16:39,810 --> 02:16:40,740
Follow me.

2213
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:46,460
我们得走了

2214
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:49,880
还给我

2215
02:16:48,550 --> 02:16:49,880
Give it to me.

2216
02:16:57,170 --> 02:17:00,200
等你有资格时 自然会得到毛拉枪

2217
02:16:57,170 --> 02:17:00,200
You will have your own maula pistol when you've earned it.

2218
02:16:57,170 --> 02:17:00,200
毛拉枪：一种会发射毒镖的弹簧枪，射程为四十米。

2219
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:02,360
把枪还我

2220
02:17:01,210 --> 02:17:02,360
Give it to me.

2221
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:10,120
契妮 新人交给你照顾了

2222
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:10,120
Chani, take charge of the newcomers.

2223
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:12,680
确保他们一路安全 我们走

2224
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:12,680
See that they are safe on the journey. Let's go.

2225
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:14,080
我不接受他们

2226
02:17:12,680 --> 02:17:14,080
I will not have them.

2227
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:21,990
詹米

2228
02:17:20,960 --> 02:17:21,990
Jamis,

2229
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:24,940
我已经下令了 别乱来

2230
02:17:22,590 --> 02:17:24,940
I have spoken. Be still.

2231
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,550
你说得好像自己是首领

2232
02:17:24,940 --> 02:17:26,550
You talk like a leader.

2233
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:29,420
但最强大的人才有资格领导

2234
02:17:27,460 --> 02:17:29,420
But the strongest leads.

2235
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:32,240
她打败了你

2236
02:17:30,650 --> 02:17:32,240
She bested you.

2237
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:35,690
我请求诉诸艾姆泰尔法则

2238
02:17:33,850 --> 02:17:35,690
I invoke the amtal.

2239
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:38,930
萨亚迪娜女祭司不容挑衅

2240
02:17:36,190 --> 02:17:38,930
You may not challenge a Sayyadina.

2241
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:40,440
那谁愿意为她而战

2242
02:17:38,930 --> 02:17:40,440
Then who will fight in her name?

2243
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,610
詹米 别这样

2244
02:17:40,440 --> 02:17:42,610
Jamis, don't do this.

2245
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:45,330
够了 黑夜即将过去

2246
02:17:43,240 --> 02:17:45,330
Don't. The night is fading.

2247
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:48,430
那就让太阳见证这场决斗

2248
02:17:45,330 --> 02:17:48,430
Then the sun will witness this death.

2249
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,160
谁要替她出战

2250
02:17:48,430 --> 02:17:50,160
Where is her champion?

2251
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,970
我接受这个人选

2252
02:18:01,260 --> 02:18:02,970
I accept her champion.

2253
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:38,810
保罗厄崔迪须先死去…

2254
02:18:34,710 --> 02:18:38,810
Paul Atreides must die...

2255
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:45,880
魁萨茨哈德拉克才能崛起

2256
02:18:41,050 --> 02:18:45,880
for Kwisatz Haderach to rise.

2257
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,710
Don't be frightened.

2258
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:51,710
不要恐惧

2259
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:54,240
也别抗拒

2260
02:18:52,260 --> 02:18:54,240
Don't resist.

2261
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:02,860
当你了结生命

2262
02:18:59,960 --> 02:19:02,860
When you take a life,

2263
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:05,020
即掌握自身命运

2264
02:19:02,860 --> 02:19:05,020
you take your own.

2265
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:38,760
我虽不相信你是李桑阿尔盖布

2266
02:19:36,600 --> 02:19:38,760
I don't believe you're the Lisan al-Gaib.

2267
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:42,220
但我仍希望你死得有尊严

2268
02:19:40,590 --> 02:19:42,220
But I want you to die with honor.

2269
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:56,770
这把晶牙匕是我姑婆给我的

2270
02:19:54,080 --> 02:19:56,770
This crysknife was given to me by my great aunt.

2271
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:04,000
由神圣的沙虫 沙漠之主的牙齿制成

2272
02:20:00,260 --> 02:20:04,000
It's made from a tooth of Shai-Hulud. The great sandworm.

2273
02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:08,670
握着它 死了也是有尊严的

2274
02:20:06,050 --> 02:20:08,670
This will be a great honor, for you to die holding it.

2275
02:20:13,090 --> 02:20:15,380
异星人在哪里

2276
02:20:13,090 --> 02:20:15,380
Where is the Outworlder?

2277
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:21,370
詹米是出色的战士

2278
02:20:19,640 --> 02:20:21,370
Jamis is a good fighter.

2279
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:23,870
你不会太痛苦

2280
02:20:22,590 --> 02:20:23,870
He won't let you suffer.

2281
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,650
契妮

2282
02:20:25,640 --> 02:20:26,650
Chani

2283
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,780
没什么

2284
02:20:39,600 --> 02:20:40,780
Never mind.

2285
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:38,380
愿你刀毁人亡

2286
02:21:36,380 --> 02:21:38,380
May thy knife chip and shatter.

2287
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:48,140
你应该感谢我的刀

2288
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:48,140
You should welcome my blade.

2289
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,480
这世界会将你凌迟至死

2290
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:53,480
This world will kill you.

2291
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,220
现在反倒干脆

2292
02:21:56,760 --> 02:21:58,220
Quicker this way.

2293
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:39,690
认不认输

2294
02:22:38,070 --> 02:22:39,690
Do you yield?

2295
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:43,770
这孩子不懂我们的规矩

2296
02:22:41,990 --> 02:22:43,770
The boy doesn't know our rule.

2297
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:46,780
艾姆泰尔法则没有认输这回事

2298
02:22:44,350 --> 02:22:46,780
There's no yielding under the amtal rule.

2299
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:48,450
不是你死就是我亡

2300
02:22:46,780 --> 02:22:48,450
Only death is the test of it.

2301
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:58,750
-他是在戏弄他吗  -不

2302
02:22:56,540 --> 02:22:58,750
- Is He toying with him?   - No.

2303
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:01,760
保罗从未杀过人

2304
02:23:00,300 --> 02:23:01,760
Paul has never killed a man.

2305
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:16,730
魁萨茨哈德拉克

2306
02:23:12,460 --> 02:23:16,730
Kwisatz Haderach.

2307
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,820
魁萨茨哈德拉克

2308
02:23:19,770 --> 02:23:22,820
Kwisatz Haderach.

2309
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:26,990
站起来 觉醒吧

2310
02:23:22,820 --> 02:23:26,990
Climb up. Rise.

2311
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,310
你现在是我们的一员了

2312
02:25:19,680 --> 02:25:21,310
You're one of us now.

2313
02:25:21,310 --> 02:25:23,110
以命换命

2314
02:25:21,310 --> 02:25:23,110
A life for a life.

2315
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:25,590
跟我们走 去泰布地下城

2316
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:25,590
Come with us to Sietch Tabr.

2317
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:28,280
不行 保罗必须离开这里

2318
02:25:25,590 --> 02:25:28,280
No. Paul needs to get off-world.

2319
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:30,620
你们肯定有门路 你们有走私者

2320
02:25:28,280 --> 02:25:30,620
You must have ways. You have smugglers,

2321
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:32,910
-你们有飞船 你们还有…  -不

2322
02:25:30,620 --> 02:25:32,910
- you have ships. You have…   - No.

2323
02:25:33,870 --> 02:25:35,950
皇帝派我们来这里

2324
02:25:33,870 --> 02:25:35,950
The Emperor sent us to this place.

2325
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,120
我父亲来了

2326
02:25:37,510 --> 02:25:39,120
And my father came,

2327
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:41,430
不为香料

2328
02:25:40,050 --> 02:25:41,430
not for spice,

2329
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:43,910
不为财富

2330
02:25:42,340 --> 02:25:43,910
not for the riches,

2331
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,840
而是为了你们弗瑞曼人的力量

2332
02:25:44,920 --> 02:25:46,840
but for the strength of your people.

2333
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:51,890
命运指引我走向沙漠

2334
02:25:49,990 --> 02:25:51,890
My road leads into the desert.

2335
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:56,010
我能看见

2336
02:25:54,670 --> 02:25:56,010
I can see it.

2337
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:00,150
若你愿意接纳我们

2338
02:25:58,660 --> 02:26:00,150
If you'll have us,

2339
02:26:01,230 --> 02:26:02,320
我们欣然前往

2340
02:26:01,230 --> 02:26:02,320
we will come.

2341
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:52,900
沙漠的力量

2342
02:26:51,490 --> 02:26:52,900
Desert power.

2343
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,910
一切才刚开始

2344
02:26:54,200 --> 02:26:55,910
This is only the beginning.
