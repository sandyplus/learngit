# My Dream Job
I don't know what is my dream job. I just don't want to waste a lot of time reading papers that I really do not interested in.
I hate writing, especially I am not familiar with the subject I want to study.
I think I should do more things that I love to instead of doing things that I am not good at.
I just DON NOT want to write. 
I really hate this feelling.
Fuck it all.
