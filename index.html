I have a dream that one day I can code for 18 hours with flow.
I am a coder.
I want to buy the domain: codingwith.me
I like coding.
Yes.
I know you like coding. BUT, PLEASE do not coding before your job is finished.
I think this is the problem you have to solve.
Literally
git commit -a -m "added a new footer"
